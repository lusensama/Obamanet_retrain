00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:08.667
The President:
March is Women's History Month,
a time not only to celebrate the

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:11.667
progress that women have made,
but also the women throughout

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:15.200
our history who have made
that progress possible.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.867
One inspiring American who comes
to mind is Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:22.867
In 1961, the former First Lady
was unhappy about the lack of

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:26.166
women in government, so she
marched up to President Kennedy

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:30.100
and handed him a three-page list
of women who were qualified for

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.166
top posts in his administration.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.066
This led the President to select
Mrs. Roosevelt as the head of a

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.734
new commission to look at the
status of women in America,

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:43.367
and the unfairness they
routinely faced in their lives.

00:00:43.367 --> 00:00:45.734
Though she passed away before
the commission could finish its

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:50.367
work, the report they released
spurred action across the country.

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:53.767
It helped galvanize a movement
led by women that would help

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:56.800
make our society a
more equal place.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.200
It's been almost 50 years
since the Roosevelt commission

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.000
published its findings -- and
there have been few similar

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.200
efforts by the government
in the decades that followed.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.867
That's why, last week,
here at the White House,

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:11.800
we released a new comprehensive
report on the status of women in

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.400
the spirit of the one that was
released half a century ago.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.900
There was a lot of positive news
about the strides we've made,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.600
even in recent years.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.600
For example, women have caught up
with men in seeking higher education.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.433
In fact, women today are more
likely than men to attend and

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:28.500
graduate from college.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.100
Yet, there are also reminders of how
much more work remains to be done.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.533
Women are still more likely to
live in poverty in this country.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.967
In education, there are areas
like math and engineering where

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:43.467
women are vastly outnumbered
by their male counterparts.

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:46.834
This is especially troubling,
for we know that to compete with

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:49.700
nations around the world, these
are the fields in which we need

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.867
to harness the talents
of all our people.

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:54.567
That's how we'll win the future.

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:58.800
And, today, women still earn on
average only about 75 cents for

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.867
every dollar a man earns.

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:02.900
That's a huge discrepancy.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.367
And at a time when folks across
this country are struggling to

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:08.166
make ends meet -- and many
families are just trying to get

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:11.467
by on one paycheck
after a job loss --

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:15.166
it's a reminder that achieving
equal pay for equal work isn't

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:16.867
just a women's issue.

00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:18.900
It's a family issue.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.800
In one of my first
acts as President,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.133
I signed a law so that women
who've been discriminated

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:27.734
against in their salaries could have
their day in court to make it right.

00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:29.767
But there are steps we should
take to prevent that from

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:31.867
happening in the first place.

00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:34.667
That's why I was so disappointed
when an important bill to give

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:37.533
women more power to
stop pay disparities --

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:42.367
the Paycheck Fairness Act -- was
blocked by just two votes in the Senate.

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:45.200
And that's why I'm going to keep
up the fight to pass the reforms

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.100
in that bill.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.600
Achieving equality and
opportunity for women isn't just

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.600
important to me as President.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.667
It's something I care about
deeply as the father of two

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:57.166
daughters who wants to see his
girls grow up in a world where

00:02:57.166 --> 00:03:00.166
there are no limits to
what they can achieve.

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:01.800
As I've traveled
across the country,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.066
visiting schools and
meeting young people,

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:06.800
I've seen so many girls
passionate about science and

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.400
other subjects that were
traditionally not open to them.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.633
We even held a science fair
here at the White House,

00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:15.800
where I met a young
woman named Amy Chyao.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.934
She was only 16 years old, but
she was actually working on a

00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:21.166
treatment for cancer.

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:23.934
She never thought,
"Science isn't for me."

00:03:23.934 --> 00:03:26.867
She never thought,
"Girls can't do that."

00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:29.500
She was just interested
in solving a problem.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.433
And because someone was
interested in giving her a

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:35.567
chance, she has the
potential to improve lives.

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:37.767
That tells me how
far we've come.

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:41.033
But it also tells me we have to
work even harder to close the

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:44.367
gaps that still exist, and to
uphold that simple American

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:48.767
ideal: we are all equal and
deserving of the chance to

00:03:48.767 --> 00:03:51.567
pursue our own
version of happiness.

00:03:51.567 --> 00:03:53.633
That's what Eleanor Roosevelt
was striving toward half a

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.300
century ago.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.166
That's why this
report matters today.

00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:02.266
And that's why, on behalf of all
our daughters and all our sons,

00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:05.467
we've got to keep making
progress in the years ahead.

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:06.700
Thanks for listening.
