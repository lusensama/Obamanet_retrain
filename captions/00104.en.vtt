00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.400
The President:
Hi everybody.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.600
In my State of the Union
Address,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.367
I said that the best measure of
opportunity is access

00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:15.867
to a good job.

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:17.200
And after the worst
recession of our

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.400
lifetimes, our businesses
have created eight

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.967
and a half million new jobs
in the last four years.

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:25.967
But we need to do more to
make America a magnet

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:27.467
for good jobs for the future.

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:30.467
And in this year of
action, where Congress

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:32.300
won't do that, I will do
whatever

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.700
I can to expand opportunity for
more Americans.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.600
This week, I took two
actions to attract

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.400
new jobs to America - jobs in
American manufacturing,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.934
and jobs rebuilding
America's infrastructure.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.767
Here's why this
is important.

00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:49.767
In the 2000s alone, we
lost more than one-third

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:52.333
of all American
manufacturing jobs.

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.333
One in three.

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.567
And when the housing
bubble burst,

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:58.500
workers in the construction
industry were hit harder

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.533
than just about anybody.

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.000
The good news is, today,
our manufacturers have

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.400
added more than 620,000
jobs

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.567
over the last four years - the
first sustained growth

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:11.166
in manufacturing jobs
since the 1990s.

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.233
Still, the economy
has changed.

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:16.834
If we want to attract more
good manufacturing jobs

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:19.600
to America, we've got to make
sure we're on the cutting

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.934
edge of new manufacturing

00:01:20.934 --> 00:01:23.667
technologies and techniques.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.500
And in today's global
economy,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
first-class jobs gravitate to
first-class infrastructure.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.767
That's why, on Tuesday, I
launched two new high-tech

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:35.400
manufacturing hubs -
places where businesses

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.300
and universities
will partner

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.233
to turn groundbreaking research
into real-world

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.333
goods Made in America.

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.567
So far, we've launched
four of these hubs, where

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:47.800
our workers can master 3-D
printing, energy-efficient

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.400
electronics, lightweight
metals,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.400
and digital manufacturing - all
technologies

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.633
that can help ensure a steady
stream of good jobs well

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:57.867
into the 21st century.

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:01.367
Then on Wednesday, I
launched a new competition

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:04.367
to build 21st century
infrastructure --

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:08.333
roads and bridges, mass transit,
more efficient ports,

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.967
and faster passenger rail.

00:02:10.967 --> 00:02:12.567
Rebuilding America
won't just attract new

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:15.667
businesses; it will create
good construction jobs

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:17.200
that can't be
shipped overseas.

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:19.967
Of course, Congress could
make an even bigger

00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:22.066
difference in both areas.

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:24.033
Thanks to the leadership
of a bipartisan group

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:26.133
of lawmakers, there's a bill
in Congress right

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:29.066
now that would create an entire
network of high-tech

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:32.000
manufacturing hubs all
across the country.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.400
And next week, I'll send
Congress a budget that

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.400
will rebuild our
transportation systems

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.867
and support millions
of jobs nationwide.

00:02:39.967 --> 00:02:43.066
There's a lot we can
do if we work together.

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:45.200
And while Congress decides
what it's going to do,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.567
I'm going to keep doing
everything in my power

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:50.433
to rebuild an economy where
everyone who works hard

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:52.700
has the chance to get
ahead --

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.967
where we're restoring our founding

00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:57.100
vision of opportunity for all.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.967
Thanks, everybody, and
have a great weekend.
