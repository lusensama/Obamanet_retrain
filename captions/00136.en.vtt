00:00:08.428 --> 00:00:10.328
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.328 --> 00:00:11.328
Two weeks ago,

00:00:11.328 --> 00:00:13.795
a large bipartisan majority
of Senators voted to pass

00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:17.561
commonsense, comprehensive 
immigration reform -

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:19.695
taking an important
step towards fixing

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:23.394
our broken immigration
system once and for all.

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:24.895
This bill was a compromise,

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:26.561
and neither side got
everything they wanted.

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:29.795
But it was largely consistent
with the key principles

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:32.828
of commonsense reform that
most of us in both parties

00:00:32.828 --> 00:00:35.094
have repeatedly laid out.

00:00:35.094 --> 00:00:37.361
If passed, the Senate's
plan would build

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:39.628
on the historic gains we've
made in border security

00:00:39.628 --> 00:00:41.127
over the past four years

00:00:41.127 --> 00:00:44.061
with the most aggressive border
security plan in our history.

00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:47.494
It would offer a pathway
to earned citizenship

00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:49.194
for the 11 million people

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:51.194
who are in this
country illegally -

00:00:51.194 --> 00:00:54.561
a pathway that includes paying
penalties, learning English,

00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:55.895
and going to the
end of the line

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:59.061
behind everyone trying
to come here legally.

00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:01.761
And it would modernize our
legal immigration system

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:05.161
to make it more consistent
with our values.

00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:06.795
The Senate's plan
would also provide

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:09.027
a big boost to our recovery.

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.695
And on Wednesday,
we released a report

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:14.294
detailing exactly how
big a boost that would be.

00:01:14.294 --> 00:01:16.561
The report is based on the
findings of independent,

00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:19.795
nonpartisan economists and
experts who concluded that,

00:01:19.795 --> 00:01:22.061
if the Senate's
plan becomes law,

00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:25.528
our economy will be 5% larger
in two decades

00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:27.361
compared to the status quo.

00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:31.528
That's $1.4 trillion
added to our economy

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:34.661
just by fixing
our immigration system.

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.661
Here in America, we've always
been a nation of immigrants.

00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:40.161
That's what's kept
our workforce dynamic,

00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:42.027
our businesses on
the cutting edge,

00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:44.828
and our economy the
strongest in the world.

00:01:44.828 --> 00:01:46.127
But under
the current system,

00:01:46.127 --> 00:01:48.394
too many smart,
hardworking immigrants

00:01:48.394 --> 00:01:51.861
are prevented from contributing 
to that success.

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:53.928
Immigration reform
would make it easier

00:01:53.928 --> 00:01:55.361
for highly-skilled immigrants

00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:58.061
and those who study at our
colleges and universities

00:01:58.061 --> 00:02:01.661
to start businesses and create
jobs right here in America.

00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:04.661
Foreign companies would be
more likely to invest here.

00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:07.328
The demand for goods and
services would go up -

00:02:07.328 --> 00:02:09.994
creating more jobs
for American workers.

00:02:09.994 --> 00:02:11.895
Every worker and business
would be required

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:13.828
to pay their
fair share in taxes,

00:02:13.828 --> 00:02:16.895
reducing our deficit
by nearly $850 billion

00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:18.994
over the next two decades.

00:02:18.994 --> 00:02:20.861
And since a large
portion of those taxes

00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:22.861
go towards retirement programs

00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:25.061
that millions
of Americans depend on,

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.361
Social Security would
actually get stronger

00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:28.661
over the long-term -

00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:32.628
adding two years to the life
of the program's trust fund.

00:02:32.628 --> 00:02:35.494
That's what immigration reform
would mean for our economy -

00:02:35.494 --> 00:02:36.628
but only if we act.

00:02:36.628 --> 00:02:39.728
If we don't do anything
to fix our broken system,

00:02:39.728 --> 00:02:43.795
our workforce will continue to
shrink as baby boomers retire.

00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:46.294
We won't benefit from
highly-skilled immigrants

00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:48.861
starting businesses
and creating jobs here.

00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:50.461
American workers
will have to make due

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:53.227
with lower wages
and fewer protections.

00:02:53.227 --> 00:02:54.994
And without more
immigrants and businesses

00:02:54.994 --> 00:02:57.194
paying their fair
share in taxes,

00:02:57.194 --> 00:02:58.761
our deficit will be higher

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.328
and programs like
Social Security

00:03:00.328 --> 00:03:03.361
will be under more strain.

00:03:03.361 --> 00:03:06.194
We've been debating this issue
for more than a decade -

00:03:06.194 --> 00:03:08.127
ever since President Bush
first proposed

00:03:08.127 --> 00:03:10.394
the broad outlines 
of immigration reform -

00:03:10.394 --> 00:03:12.895
and I think he gave a very
good speech this past week

00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:15.261
expressing his hope
that a bipartisan,

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:18.394
comprehensive bill
can become law.

00:03:18.394 --> 00:03:20.261
If Democrats and Republicans -

00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:22.928
including President Bush and I -

00:03:22.928 --> 00:03:24.394
can agree on something,

00:03:24.394 --> 00:03:26.861
that's a pretty good
place to start.

00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:28.528
Now the House needs to act

00:03:28.528 --> 00:03:31.695
so I can sign commonsense 
immigration reform into law.

00:03:31.695 --> 00:03:33.494
And if you agree,

00:03:33.494 --> 00:03:36.461
tell your Representatives
that now is the time.

00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:39.061
Call or email or post
on their Facebook walls

00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:41.461
and ask them to get this done.

00:03:41.461 --> 00:03:43.695
Because together,
we can grow our economy

00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:46.928
and keep America strong
for years to come.

00:03:46.928 --> 00:03:48.761
Thanks,
and have a great weekend.
