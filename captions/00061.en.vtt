00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:12.112
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.280
At a moment when our
economy is growing,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.649
our businesses are creating
jobs at the fastest pace

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.352
since the 1990s, and wages
are starting to rise

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.122
again, we have to make some
choices about the kind

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.023
of country we want to be.

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.159
Will we accept an
economy where only

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.162
a few of us do
spectacularly well?

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.865
Or will we build an
economy where everyone

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.701
who works hard has a
chance to get ahead?

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:37.570
That was the focus of my
State of the Union Address -

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.739
middle-class economics.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.809
The idea that this country
does best when everyone gets

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.845
their fair shot, everyone
does their fair share,

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:49.215
and everyone plays by
the same set of rules.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:52.118
This week, I will send a
budget to Congress that's

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:54.587
built on those values.

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.390
We'll help working families'
paychecks go farther

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.160
by treating things like
paid leave and child care

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.696
like the economic
priorities that they are.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.598
We'll offer Americans
of every age the chance

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:08.401
to upgrade their skills so
they can earn higher wages,

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.371
with plans like making two
years of community college

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.641
free for every
responsible student.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.477
And we'll keep building the
world's most attractive economy

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:20.880
for high-wage jobs, with new
investments in research,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.518
infrastructure, manufacturing,
and expanded access to faster

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:28.121
internet and new markets.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.356
We can afford to make
these investments.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.559
Since I took office, we've
cut our deficits by about

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:36.062
two-thirds - the fastest
sustained deficit reduction

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:39.032
since just after the
end of World War II.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:40.700
We just have to be smarter
about how we pay for

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.770
our priorities, and that's
what my budget does.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.039
It proposes getting rid of
special interest loopholes

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.242
in our tax code, and using
those savings to cut taxes

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:52.078
for middle-class families
and reward businesses that

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.280
invest in America.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.317
It refuses to play politics
with our homeland security,

00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:01.254
and funds our national security
priorities at home and abroad.

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:04.958
And it undoes the arbitrary,
across-the-board budget cuts

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.061
known as "the sequester"
for our domestic priorities,

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.029
and matches those investments
dollar-for-dollar

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.933
in resources our troops need
to get the job done.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.235
Now, I know that there
are Republicans

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:18.004
in Congress who disagree
with my approach.

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.006
Like I said in my
State of the Union,

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.208
if they have ideas that will
help middle-class families

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:27.547
feel some economic security,
I'm all in to work with them.

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:30.316
But I will keep doing
everything I can to help more

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:33.586
working families make
ends meet and get ahead.

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.588
Not just because we want
everyone to share in America's

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:39.125
success - but because we
want everyone to contribute

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.327
to America's success.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.962
That's the way the
middle class thrived

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:44.731
in the last century
- and that's how

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.833
it will thrive again.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.135
Thanks, everybody and
have a great weekend.
