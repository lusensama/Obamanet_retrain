00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.667
The President:
On Friday, we received better
news than we expected about the

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:14.467
state of our economy.

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:18.233
We learned that we lost 247,000
jobs in July --

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:22.000
some 200,000 fewer jobs than we lost in June,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.734
and far fewer than the nearly
700,000 a month we were losing

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.600
at the beginning of the year.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.867
Of course, this is little
comfort to anyone who saw their

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:33.066
job disappear in July, and to
the millions of Americans who

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.734
are looking for work.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:39.700
And I will not rest until anyone
who's looking for work can find a job.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.400
Still, this month's jobs numbers
are a sign that we've begun to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.300
put the brakes on this recession
and that the worst may be behind us.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.433
But we must do more than rescue
our economy from this immediate

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:55.266
crisis; we must rebuild it
stronger than before.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:59.333
We must lay a new foundation for
future growth and prosperity,

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:02.600
and a key pillar of a new
foundation is health insurance

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.433
reform -- reform that we are now closer to achieving than ever before.

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:10.600
There are still details to be
hammered out.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.066
There are still differences to
be reconciled.

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:16.867
But we are moving toward a broad
consensus on reform.

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:19.800
Four committees in Congress have
produced legislation --

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.100
an unprecedented level of
agreement on a difficult and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.867
complex challenge.

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:27.333
In addition to the ongoing work
in Congress,

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.934
providers have agreed to bring
down costs.

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:32.734
Drug companies have agreed to
make prescription drugs more

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:34.467
affordable for seniors.

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:38.433
The AARP supports reform because
of the better care it will offer

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:39.633
to seniors.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:42.233
And the American Nurses
Association and the American

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:45.800
Medical Association, which
represent the millions of nurses

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.967
and doctors who know our health
care system best,

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:51.133
all support reform, as well.

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.900
As we draw close to finalizing
-- and passing --

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.100
real health insurance reform,
the defenders of the status quo

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.900
and political point-scorers in
Washington are growing fiercer

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.734
in their opposition.

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:05.433
In recent days and weeks, some
have been using misleading

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:08.467
information to defeat what they
know is the best chance of

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:10.567
reform we have ever had.

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:13.033
And that's why it's important,
especially now,

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.166
as Senators and Representatives
head home and meet with their

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:18.500
constituents, for you, the
American people,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.734
to have all the facts.

00:02:20.734 --> 00:02:23.734
So, let me explain what reform
will mean for you.

00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:27.467
And let me start by dispelling
the outlandish rumors that

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:31.433
reform will promote euthanasia,
or cut Medicaid,

00:02:31.433 --> 00:02:34.433
or bring about a government
takeover of health care.

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:36.700
That's simply not true.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.867
This isn't about putting
government in charge of your

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:42.166
health insurance; it's about
putting you in charge of your

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:43.667
health insurance.

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:46.667
Under the reforms we seek, if
you like your doctor,

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.367
you can keep your doctor.

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:50.233
If you like your health care
plan,

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:52.934
you can keep your health care
plan.

00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:56.233
And while reform is obviously
essential for the 46 million

00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:58.767
Americans who don't have health
insurance,

00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:02.300
it will also provide more
stability and security to the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.133
hundreds of millions who do.

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:07.400
Right now, we have a system that
works well for the insurance

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.734
industry, but that doesn't
always work well for you.

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:13.266
What we need, and what we will
have when we pass health

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:17.166
insurance reform, are consumer
protections to make sure that

00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:20.367
those who have insurance are
treated fairly and that

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:23.100
insurance companies are held
accountable.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.734
We'll require insurance
companies to cover routine

00:03:25.734 --> 00:03:28.400
checkups and preventive care,
like mammograms and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.133
colonoscopies, or eye and foot exams for diabetics,

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:34.533
so we can avoid chronic
illnesses that cost too many

00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:37.166
lives and too much money.

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.700
We'll stop insurance companies
from denying coverage because of

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.867
a person's medical history.

00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:43.667
I'll never forget watching my own mother,

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:46.033
as she fought cancer in her
final days,

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:48.600
worrying about whether her
insurer would claim her illness

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.867
was a preexisting condition.

00:03:50.867 --> 00:03:54.000
I've met so many Americans who
worry about the same thing.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.066
And that's why, under these reforms,

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:59.266
insurance companies will no longer be able to deny coverage

00:03:59.266 --> 00:04:02.400
because of a previous illness or injury.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.000
And insurance companies will no
longer be allowed to drop or

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.300
water down coverage for someone
who has become seriously ill.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.533
Your health insurance ought to
be there for you when it counts

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:15.333
-- and reform will make sure it is.

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:18.367
With reform, insurance companies
will also have to limit how much

00:04:18.367 --> 00:04:21.367
you can be charged for
out-of-pocket expenses.

00:04:21.367 --> 00:04:24.033
And we will stop insurance
companies from placing arbitrary

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:27.734
caps on the amount of coverage
you can receive in a given year

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:31.300
or a lifetime because no one in
America should go broke because

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.533
of an illness.

00:04:32.533 --> 00:04:35.133
In the end, the debate about
health insurance reform boils

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:38.033
down to a choice between two
approaches.

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:41.033
The first is almost guaranteed
to double health care costs over

00:04:41.033 --> 00:04:43.934
the next decade, leave millions more Americans without

00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:46.767
insurance, leave those with insurance vulnerable to

00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:51.734
arbitrary denials of coverage, and bankrupt state and federal governments.

00:04:51.734 --> 00:04:53.600
That's the status quo.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.367
That's the health care system we
have right now.

00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:58.867
So, we can either continue this
approach,

00:04:58.867 --> 00:05:01.834
or we can choose another one -- one that will protect people

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:04.800
against unfair insurance practices; provide quality,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.333
affordable insurance to every American;

00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:11.133
and bring down rising costs that are swamping families,

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:13.633
businesses, and our budgets.

00:05:13.633 --> 00:05:17.300
That's the health care system we
can bring about with reform.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.533
There are those who are focused
on the so-called politics of

00:05:19.533 --> 00:05:23.400
health care; who are trying to
exploit differences or concerns

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.066
for political gain.

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:26.266
And that's to be expected.

00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:27.633
That's Washington.

00:05:27.633 --> 00:05:30.934
But let's never forget that this
isn't about politics.

00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:32.900
This is about people's lives.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.934
This is about people's
businesses.

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:37.133
This is about America's future.

00:05:37.133 --> 00:05:38.934
That's what's at stake.

00:05:38.934 --> 00:05:42.166
And that's why health insurance
reform is so important.

00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:44.700
That's why we have to get this
done --

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.567
and why we will get this done -- by the end of this year.

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:49.800
Thanks so much.
