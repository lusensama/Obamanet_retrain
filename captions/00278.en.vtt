00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.967
The President:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:09.333
I'm speaking to you from the
GM auto plant here in Detroit,

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.900
Michigan, where a hopeful story
is unfolding in a place that's

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.533
been one of the
hardest hit in America.

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.567
In the 12 months
before I took office,

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:20.767
American auto companies lost
hundreds of thousands of jobs.

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:23.500
Sales plunged 40%.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.700
Liquidation was a
very real possibility.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.934
Years of papering over tough
problems and a failing to adapt

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:34.033
to changing times -- combined with a vicious economic crisis

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.367
-- brought an industry that's been the symbol of our

00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:40.600
manufacturing might for a century to the brink of collapse.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.600
We didn't have
many good options.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.700
On the one hand, we could
have continued the practice of

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.200
handing out billions of taxpayer
dollars to the auto industry

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.367
with no real strings attached.

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:53.233
On the other hand, we could have
walked away and allowed two

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:55.867
major auto companies to
go out of business --

00:00:55.867 --> 00:00:59.600
which could have wiped out
one million American jobs.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.633
I refused to let that happen.

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:03.767
So we came up with a third way.

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:06.333
We said to the auto companies, if you're willing to make the

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.300
hard decisions necessary to adapt and compete in the 21st

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.266
century, we'll make a one-time
investment in your future.

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.700
Of course, if some
folks had their way,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.133
none of this would
be happening at all.

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:22.367
This plant might not exist, because there were leaders of

00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:25.033
the "just say no"
crowd in Washington who

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:29.400
argued that standing by the
auto industry would guarantee failure.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.133
One called it "the worst
investment you could possibly make."

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:37.700
They said we should just walk
away and let these jobs go.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.233
Today, the men and women in this
plant are proving these cynics wrong.

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:45.567
Since GM and Chrysler
emerged from bankruptcy,

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:49.233
our auto industry has
added 55,000 jobs --

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:52.834
the strongest period of job
growth in more than 10 years.

00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:56.934
For the first time since 2004,
all three American automakers

00:01:56.934 --> 00:01:59.333
are operating at a profit.

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.367
Sales have begun to rebound.

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:04.734
And plants like this that
wouldn't have existed if all of

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:09.400
us didn't act are now
operating maximum capacity.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.800
What's more, thanks
to our investments,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.867
a lot of these auto companies
are reinventing themselves to

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.133
meet the demands of a new age.

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:19.667
At this plant, they're hard at
work building the high-quality,

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:21.934
fuel-efficient
cars of tomorrow --

00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:25.600
cars like the plug-in hybrid
Chevy Volt that can run 40 miles

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.367
before taking a sip of gasoline.

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:31.767
Throughout Michigan, an advanced
battery industry is taking root

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:34.433
that will power clean
electric cars --

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:36.900
an industry that produced only
2% of the world's advanced

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.867
batteries last year, but will
now be able to produce as much

00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:43.834
as 40% in a little
over five years.

00:02:43.834 --> 00:02:45.633
That's real progress.

00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:48.000
There's no doubt that we have a
long way to go and a lot of work

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.800
to do before folks here and
across America can feel whole again.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.800
But what's important is that
we're finally beginning to see

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.934
some of the tough
decisions we made pay off.

00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:01.633
And if we had listened to the
cynics and the naysayers --

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:04.934
if we had simply done what the
politics of the moment required

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:08.200
-- none of this progress
would have happened.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.500
Still, even as these icons of
American industry are being

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.200
reborn, we also need to stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.767
America's small
businessmen and women --

00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:20.367
particularly since they're the
ones who create most of the new

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.900
jobs in this country.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.600
As we work to
rebuild our economy,

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.533
I can't imagine anything more
common-sense than giving

00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:30.900
additional tax breaks and
badly-needed lending assistance

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.333
to America's small business
owners so they can grow and hire.

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:38.633
That's what we're trying to do
with the Small Business Jobs Act

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:40.967
-- a bill that has been
praised as being good for small

00:03:40.967 --> 00:03:44.400
businesses by groups like the Chamber of Commerce and the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.500
National Federation of
Independent Business.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.800
It's a bill that includes
provision after provision

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.233
authored by both
Democrats and Republicans.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:57.066
But yesterday, the Republican
leaders in the Senate once again

00:03:57.066 --> 00:04:00.934
used parliamentary
procedures to block it.

00:04:00.934 --> 00:04:03.934
Understand, a majority of
Senators support the plan.

00:04:03.934 --> 00:04:06.533
It's just that the Republican
leaders in the Senate won't even

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:10.367
allow it to come up for a vote.

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:11.700
That isn't right.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.934
And I'm calling on the
Republican leaders in the Senate

00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:17.533
to stop holding America's small
businesses hostage to politics,

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:22.333
and allow an up-or-down vote on
this small business jobs bill.

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:25.066
At a time when America is just
starting to move forward again,

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:27.800
we can't afford the do-nothing
policies and partisan

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.867
maneuvering that will
only take us backward.

00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:34.700
I won't sit here and pretend
everything's wonderful.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.500
I know that times are tough.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.600
But what I also know is that
we've made it through tough

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.834
times before.

00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:41.867
And we'll make it through again.

00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:45.200
The men and women hard at work
in this auto plant makes me

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.967
absolutely confident of that.

00:04:47.967 --> 00:04:49.633
So to all the
naysayers out there,

00:04:49.633 --> 00:04:53.600
I say this: Don't ever bet
against the American people.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.567
Don't bet against
the American worker.

00:04:55.567 --> 00:04:58.000
Because we don't take
the easy way out.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.133
That's not how we
deal with challenge.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.233
That's not how we built this
country into the greatest

00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:05.233
economic power the
world has ever known.

00:05:05.233 --> 00:05:08.166
We did it by summoning the
courage to persevere, and adapt,

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:11.266
and push this country
forward, inch by inch.

00:05:11.266 --> 00:05:13.467
That's the spirit I see
in this plant today,

00:05:13.467 --> 00:05:15.100
and as long as I have the
privilege of being your

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.266
President, I will keep fighting
alongside you until we reach a

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:20.900
better day.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.233
Thanks.
