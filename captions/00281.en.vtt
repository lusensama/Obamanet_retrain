00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.867
The President:
Last weekend, on
the Fourth of July,

00:00:07.867 --> 00:00:10.834
Michelle and I welcomed some of
our extraordinary military men

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:13.934
and women and their
families to the White House.

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:15.934
They were just like the
thousands of active duty

00:00:15.934 --> 00:00:19.133
personnel and veterans that
I've met across this country and

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.567
around the globe.

00:00:20.567 --> 00:00:21.333
Proud.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.333
Strong.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.600
Determined.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.967
Men and women with the courage
to answer their country's call,

00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:30.467
and the character to serve
the United States of America.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:33.967
Because of that service; because
of the honor and heroism of our

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.967
troops around the world;
our people are safer,

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:40.667
our nation is more secure, and
we are poised to end our combat

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:43.133
mission in Iraq by
the end of August,

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:48.700
completing a drawdown of more than 90,000 troops since last January.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.400
Still, we are a nation at war.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.033
For the better part of a decade,
our men and women in uniform

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:58.867
have endured tour after tour in
distant and dangerous places.

00:00:58.867 --> 00:01:00.800
Many have risked their lives.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.834
Many have given their lives.

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:05.934
And as a grateful nation,
humbled by their service,

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:08.266
we can never honor these
American heroes or their

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.133
families enough.

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.633
Just as we have a solemn
responsibility to train and

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:15.834
equip our troops before we
send them into harm's way,

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:18.734
we have a solemn responsibility
to provide our veterans and

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:21.767
wounded warriors with the care
and benefits they've earned when

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:23.533
they come home.

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.867
That's our sacred trust
with all who serve --

00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:29.133
and it doesn't end when
their tour of duty does.

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:32.900
To keep that trust, we're
building a 21st century VA,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.767
increasing its budget, and
ensuring the steady stream of

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:39.800
funding it needs to support
medical care for our veterans.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.700
To help our veterans and their
families pursue a college

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.767
education, we're funding and
implementing the post-9/11 GI Bill.

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:48.900
To deliver better
care in more places,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.300
we're expanding and
increasing VA health care,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.467
building new wounded
warrior facilities,

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:57.600
and adapting care to better meet
the needs of female veterans.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.500
To stand with those
who sacrifice,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.233
we've dedicated new support
for wounded warriors and the

00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:06.667
caregivers who put their lives
on hold for a loved one's long recovery.

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:10.033
And to do right by our vets,
we're working to prevent and end

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:13.367
veteran homelessness -- because in the United States of America,

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:17.867
no one who served in our uniform
should sleep on our streets.

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:20.500
We also know that for many
of today's troops and their

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.233
families, the war doesn't
end when they come home.

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:26.734
Too many suffer from the
signature injuries of today's

00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:31.600
wars: Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.700
And too few receive the
screening and the treatment that they need.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.300
Now, in past wars, this wasn't
something America always talked about.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.000
And as a result, our troops
and their families often felt

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.934
stigmatized or embarrassed
when it came to seeking help.

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:50.266
Today, we've made it clear up
and down the chain of command

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:53.100
that folks should seek
help if they need it.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.467
In fact, we've expanded mental
health counseling and services

00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:57.800
for our vets.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.066
But for years, many veterans
with PTSD who have tried to seek

00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:04.767
benefits -- veterans of today's wars and earlier wars --

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:07.000
have often found
themselves stymied.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.100
They've been required to produce
evidence proving that a specific

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.567
event caused their PTSD.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:16.200
And that practice has kept the
vast majority of those with PTSD

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.867
who served in non-combat roles,
but who still waged war,

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:22.233
from getting the care they need.

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:25.000
Well, I don't think our troops
on the battlefield should have

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.667
to keep notes just in case
they need to apply for a claim.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.000
And I've met enough veterans
to know that you don't have to

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.066
engage in a firefight to
endure the trauma of war.

00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:37.834
So we're changing the
way things are done.

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:40.333
On Monday, the Department
of Veterans Affairs,

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:43.934
led by Secretary Ric Shinseki,
will begin making it easier for

00:03:43.934 --> 00:03:48.433
a veteran with PTSD to get
the benefits he or she needs.

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:51.834
This is a long-overdue step that
will help veterans not just of

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:56.333
the Afghan and Iraq Wars, but generations of their brave

00:03:56.333 --> 00:04:01.233
predecessors who proudly served
and sacrificed in all our wars.

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:04.233
It's a step that proves that America will always be there for

00:04:04.233 --> 00:04:07.567
our veterans, just as they've always been there for us.

00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:09.300
We won't let them down.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.333
We take care of our own.

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:13.100
And as long as I'm
Commander-in-Chief,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.333
that's what we're
going to keep doing.

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:16.433
Thanks.
