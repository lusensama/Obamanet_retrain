00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:08.300
The President:
In just two weeks, we'll
come together, as a nation,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.233
to mark the 10th anniversary
of the September 11th attacks.

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:14.567
We'll remember the
innocent lives we lost.

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:18.033
We'll stand with the
families who loved them.

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:20.834
We'll honor the heroic first
responders who rushed to the

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:23.533
scene and saved so many.

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:27.033
And we'll pay tribute to our
troops and military families,

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:30.033
and all those who have served
over the past ten years,

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:33.367
to keep us safe and strong.

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:36.133
We'll also recall how the worst
terrorist attack in American

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:40.066
history brought out the
best in the American people.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.400
How Americans lined
up to give blood.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.200
How volunteers drove across
the country to lend a hand.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.266
How schoolchildren
donated their savings.

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:53.567
How communities, faith groups
and businesses collected food

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:55.500
and clothing.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.700
We were united, and the
outpouring of generosity and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.600
compassion reminded us
that in times of challenge,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.633
we Americans move forward
together, as one people.

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:08.133
This September 11th,
Michelle and I will join the

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:11.033
commemorations at Ground
Zero, in Shanksville,

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:13.033
and at the Pentagon.

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:16.433
But even if you can't be in New
York, Pennsylvania or Virginia,

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:19.834
every American can be
part of this anniversary.

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:23.066
Once again, 9/11 will be
a National Day of Service

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.934
and Remembrance.

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:27.900
And in the days and weeks ahead,
folks across the country --

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.066
in all 50 states --
will come together,

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.033
in their communities
and neighborhoods,

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:35.433
to honor the victims of 9/11 and
to reaffirm the strength of our

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:39.300
nation with acts of
service and charity.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.166
In Minneapolis, volunteers will
help restore a community center.

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.033
In Winston-Salem,
North Carolina,

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:47.834
they'll hammer shingles and
lay floors to give a family

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:49.300
a new home.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.900
In Tallahassee, Florida, they'll
assemble care packages for our

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.500
troops overseas and their
families here at home.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.033
In Orange County, California,
they'll renovate homes for

00:01:58.033 --> 00:01:59.433
our veterans.

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:02.300
And once again, Michelle and I
look forward to joining a local

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.934
service project as well.

00:02:04.934 --> 00:02:07.166
There are so many
ways to get involved,

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:09.667
and every American
can do something.

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:12.367
To learn more about the
opportunities where you live,

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:16.166
just go online and
visit Serve.gov.

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:18.467
Even the smallest
act of service,

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:23.233
the simplest act of kindness, is
a way to honor those we lost;

00:02:23.233 --> 00:02:27.133
a way to reclaim that spirit
of unity that followed 9/11.

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:30.400
On this 10th anniversary, we
still face great challenges as

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.800
a nation.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.600
We're emerging from the
worst economic crisis in

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.333
our lifetimes.

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:36.867
We're taking the
fight to al Qaeda,

00:02:36.867 --> 00:02:39.033
and ending the war in Iraq and
starting to bring our troops

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:41.300
home from Afghanistan.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.800
And we're working to rebuild
the foundation of our national

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.333
strength here at home.

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.200
None of this will be easy.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.233
And it can't be the work
of government alone.

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:54.066
As we saw after 9/11, the
strength of America has always

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:56.934
been the character and
compassion of our people.

00:02:56.934 --> 00:02:59.500
So as we mark this
solemn anniversary,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.533
let's summon that
spirit once more.

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:06.133
And let's show that the sense of
common purpose that we need in

00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:09.567
America doesn't have to
be a fleeting moment;

00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:13.300
it can be a lasting virtue
-- not just on one day,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.867
but every day.
