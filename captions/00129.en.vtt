00:00:08.861 --> 00:00:10.194
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.194 --> 00:00:11.194
This Labor Day weekend,

00:00:11.194 --> 00:00:12.695
as we gather with
family and friends,

00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:14.394
we'll also come
together as a nation

00:00:14.394 --> 00:00:16.361
to honor some of our own -

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:18.761
the working men and
women of America

00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:19.994
who, across the generations,

00:00:19.994 --> 00:00:21.528
built this country up

00:00:21.528 --> 00:00:24.328
and helped make us
who we are today.

00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:27.194
On Monday, we'll celebrate
that proud history.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:30.695
We'll pay tribute to the values
working Americans embody -

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:34.328
hard work; responsibility; 
sacrifice;

00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:36.394
looking out for one another.

00:00:36.394 --> 00:00:38.994
And we'll recommit
ourselves to their cause;

00:00:38.994 --> 00:00:41.895
to securing for them a better
bargain so that everyone

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:45.895
who works hard in America
has a chance to get ahead.

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:47.594
See, over the past
four and a half years,

00:00:47.594 --> 00:00:48.795
we've fought our way back

00:00:48.795 --> 00:00:51.294
from the worst recession
of our lifetimes.

00:00:51.294 --> 00:00:53.061
And thanks to the grit
and resilience

00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:54.428
of the American people,

00:00:54.428 --> 00:00:56.928
we've begun to lay
a foundation for stronger,

00:00:56.928 --> 00:00:58.361
more durable economic growth.

00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:01.394
But as any working
family will tell you,

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:04.061
we're not where we need to be.

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:05.728
For over a decade,
working Americans

00:01:05.728 --> 00:01:07.895
have seen their wages
and incomes stagnate,

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:09.494
even as corporate
profits soar

00:01:09.494 --> 00:01:13.094
and the pay of a
fortunate few explodes.

00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:16.494
For even longer than that,
inequality has steadily risen;

00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:18.628
the journey of upward
mobility has become harder.

00:01:18.628 --> 00:01:21.594
And in too many communities
across this country,

00:01:21.594 --> 00:01:24.328
the shadow of poverty
continues to cast a pall

00:01:24.328 --> 00:01:26.528
over our fellow citizens.

00:01:26.528 --> 00:01:29.994
Reversing that trend needs to be
Washington's highest priority.

00:01:29.994 --> 00:01:31.961
And it sure is mine.

00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:33.194
That's why, over the past month,

00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:34.961
I've traveled
all across America,

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:37.328
laying out my ideas
for how we can build

00:01:37.328 --> 00:01:40.628
on the cornerstones of what
it means to be middle class.

00:01:40.628 --> 00:01:42.928
A good job that
pays a good wage.

00:01:42.928 --> 00:01:43.928
A good education.

00:01:43.928 --> 00:01:45.728
A home of your own.

00:01:45.728 --> 00:01:47.594
Health care when you get sick.

00:01:47.594 --> 00:01:50.294
A secure retirement
even if you're not rich.

00:01:50.294 --> 00:01:52.361
And more chances for
folks to earn their way

00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:53.361
into the middle class

00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:56.394
as long as they're
willing to work for it.

00:01:56.394 --> 00:01:58.428
The truth is, it's not
going to be easy to reverse

00:01:58.428 --> 00:02:00.294
the forces that have
conspired - for decades -

00:02:00.294 --> 00:02:01.494
against working Americans.

00:02:01.494 --> 00:02:04.061
But if we take
a few bold steps -

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:06.528
and if Washington
is able to come together

00:02:06.528 --> 00:02:09.528
with common purpose
and common resolve -

00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:10.895
we'll get there.

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:13.861
Our economy will keep getting
stronger and more Americans

00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:17.161
will be able to join the ranks
of the middle-class.

00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:18.461
So this Labor Day,

00:02:18.461 --> 00:02:20.394
while you're out there
grilling in the backyard,

00:02:20.394 --> 00:02:22.294
or taking that final
trip for the summer,

00:02:22.294 --> 00:02:25.061
I hope you'll also
take a moment to reflect

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:29.227
on the many contributions
of our working men and women.

00:02:29.227 --> 00:02:32.227
For generations, it was the
great American middle class

00:02:32.227 --> 00:02:34.161
that made our economy
the envy of the world.

00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:36.695
And as long as I'm President,
I'm going to keep fighting

00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:39.194
to make sure
that happens again.

00:02:39.194 --> 00:02:41.027
Thanks,
and have a great weekend.
