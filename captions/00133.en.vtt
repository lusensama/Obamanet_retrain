00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:06.967
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:09.867
This week, I went down to an
Amazon warehouse in Tennessee

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:11.467
to talk more about
what we need to do

00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:14.100
to secure a better bargain
for the middle class -

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.567
to make sure that anyone who
works hard can get ahead

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:18.734
in the 21st century economy.

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:19.967
Over the past four
and a half years,

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:22.000
we've fought our way back
from the worst recession

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.400
of our lifetimes and begun
to lay a foundation

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.133
for stronger, more durable economic growth.

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.900
Today, our businesses
have created 7.3 million

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.266
new jobs over the
last 41 months.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.000
We now sell more
products made in America

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.533
to the rest of the
world than ever before.

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.867
Health care costs are growing
at the slowest rate in 50 years,

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:44.433
and our deficits are falling at
the fastest rate in 60 years.

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:46.800
But as any middle-class
family will tell you,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.000
we're not where
we need to be yet.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.834
Even before the crisis hit,

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:53.633
we were living through a decade where a few at the top

00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:54.633
were doing better and better,

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.333
while most families were working
harder and harder

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.233
just to get by.

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:03.633
Reversing this trend must be
Washington's highest priority.

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:05.567
It sure is mine.

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:07.367
But too often over
the past two years,

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:10.233
Washington has taken
its eye off the ball.

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:12.900
They've allowed an endless
parade of political posturing

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.400
and phony scandals to distract
from growing our economy

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.367
and strengthening
the middle class.

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:22.600
That's why I'm laying out my
ideas for how we can build

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.100
on the cornerstones
of what it means

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.500
to be middle class in America.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.967
A good education.

00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:29.533
A home of your own.

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.500
Health care when you get sick.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.600
A secure retirement
even if you're not rich.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.867
And the most important
cornerstone of all:

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:39.834
a good job in a durable,
growing industry.

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:43.934
When it comes to creating more
good jobs that pay decent wages,

00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:46.433
the problem is not
a lack of ideas.

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:48.033
Plenty of independent
economists,

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:50.967
business owners and people
from both parties agree

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:52.900
on what we have to do.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.333
I proposed many of these
ideas two years ago

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:57.133
in the American Jobs Act.

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.867
And this week, I put forward
common-sense proposals

00:01:59.867 --> 00:02:03.166
for how we can create more
jobs in manufacturing;

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:05.467
in wind, solar and natural gas;

00:02:05.467 --> 00:02:07.900
and by rebuilding
America's infrastructure.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.600
What we're lacking is
action from Washington.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.700
And that's why, in
addition to proposing ideas

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.633
that we know
will grow our economy,

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:17.100
I've also put
forward a strategy

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.166
for breaking through
the Washington logjam -

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.567
a "grand bargain"
for the middle class.

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:25.000
I'm willing to work with
Republicans to simplify

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.200
our tax code for businesses
large and small,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.467
but only if we take the money
we save by transitioning

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:34.600
to a simpler tax system and
make a significant investment

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.200
in creating good,
middle-class jobs.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.500
We can put
construction workers

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.333
back on the job rebuilding
our infrastructure.

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:44.400
We can boost manufacturing,
so more American companies

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.900
can sell their products
around the world.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.066
And we can help our community
colleges arm our workers

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.767
with the skills they
need in a global economy -

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:56.400
all without adding
a dime to the deficit.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.700
I'll keep laying out my
ideas to give the middle class

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.100
a better shot
in the 21st century,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.300
and I'll keep reaching out
to Republicans for theirs.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.734
But gutting critical
investments in our future

00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:09.767
and threatening national default
on the bills that Congress

00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:11.500
has already racked up -

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.734
that's not an economic plan.

00:03:13.734 --> 00:03:15.967
Denying health care
to millions of Americans,

00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:17.233
or shutting down the government

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:19.567
just because I'm
for keeping it open -

00:03:19.567 --> 00:03:21.834
that won't help
the middle class.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.600
The truth is,
there are no gimmicks

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.000
when it comes to creating jobs.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
There are no tricks
to grow the economy.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.633
Reversing the long erosion
of middle-class security

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:32.600
in this country won't be easy.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.500
But if we work together and
take a few bold steps -

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.633
and if Washington is
willing to set aside politics

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:41.200
and focus on what
really matters -

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.433
we can grow our economy

00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:45.166
and give the middle class
a better bargain.

00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:46.900
And together, we can make
this country a place

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.000
where everyone who works
hard can get ahead.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.333
Thanks,
and have a great weekend.
