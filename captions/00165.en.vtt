00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.033
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm here on the factory floor
of a business in Hatfield,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.333
Pennsylvania, where folks are
working around the clock making

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.200
toys to keep up with
the Christmas rush.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.033
And I came here because,
back in Washington,

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:21.667
the clock is ticking on some
important decisions that will

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:23.867
have a real impact
on our businesses --

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:26.166
and on families like yours.

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:29.900
The most pressing decision
has to do with your taxes.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.667
See, at the end of the year,
middle-class tax cuts are set

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:33.967
to expire.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.400
And there are two
things that can happen.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.033
First, if Congress does nothing,
every family will see their

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:43.900
income taxes automatically go up
at the beginning of next year.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.834
A typical middle class family of
four will see their income taxes

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:50.033
rise by $2,200.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:51.767
We can't let that happen.

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:55.800
Our families can't afford it,
and neither can our economy.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.133
The second option is better.

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:01.300
Right now, Congress can pass
a law that would prevent a tax

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.967
hike on the first $250,000
of everybody's income.

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:07.433
Everybody.

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:11.633
That means that 98% of Americans
and 97% of small businesses

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:15.000
wouldn't see their income
taxes go up at all.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.233
And even the wealthiest
Americans would get a tax cut on

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:21.266
the first $250,000
of their incomes.

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.667
Congress can do that right now.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.333
They can give families like
yours a sense of security going

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.834
into the New Year.

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:30.400
They can give companies like
this one some certainty about

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.600
what to expect down the road.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.367
And with the issue behind us,
we'll have more time to work out

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:39.133
a plan to bring down our
deficits in a balanced way --

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:41.300
including by asking the
wealthiest Americans to pay a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.166
little more, so we can still
invest in the things that make

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:48.166
our nation strong, like
education and research.

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:51.233
So let's begin by doing
what we all agree on.

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:55.000
Both parties say we should
keep middle-class taxes low.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.066
The Senate has already passed a
bill to keep income taxes from

00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:00.500
going up on
middle-class families.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.633
Democrats in the House are
ready to do the same thing.

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:07.133
And if we can just get a few
House Republicans on board,

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:11.633
I'll sign this bill as soon
as Congress sends it my way.

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:14.867
But it's unacceptable for some
Republicans in Congress to hold

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:18.500
middle class tax cuts hostage
simply because they refuse to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.033
let tax rates go up on
the wealthiest Americans.

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:25.533
And if you agree with me, then
I could sure use your help.

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:29.700
Let your congressman know
what $2,000 means to you.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.133
Give them a call.

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:32.567
Write them an email.

00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:36.700
Or tweet them using
the hashtag "My2K."

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.734
That's My2K.

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:41.100
You and your family have a
lot riding on the outcome of

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.500
this debate.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.633
We all do.

00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:47.066
And as citizens, we all have a
say in the country we want to

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:50.600
build -- not just on
election day, but every day.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.400
So make your voice heard.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.367
I promise, it
makes a difference.

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:57.467
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
