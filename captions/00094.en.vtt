00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.640
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.830
It’s Memorial Day weekend – a chance for
Americans to get together with family and

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.100
friends,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.760
break out the grill, and kick off the unofficial
start of summer.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.849
More importantly, it’s a time to remember
the heroes whose sacrifices made these moments

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.210
possible –-

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.610
our men and women in uniform who gave their
lives to keep our nation safe and free.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.739
From those shots fired at Lexington and Concord
more than two centuries ago to our newest

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.760
generation of veterans of the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.760
our history shines with patriots who answered
the call to serve.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.870
They put their lives on the line to defend
the country they loved.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.489
And in the end, many gave that “last full
measure of devotion” so that our nation

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.890
would endure.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.019
Every single one of us owes our fallen heroes
a profound debt of gratitude.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.799
Because every time we cast our votes or speak
our minds without fear, it’s because they

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.880
fought for our right to do that.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.720
Every chance we get to make a better life
for ourselves and our families is possible

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.159
because generations of patriots fought to
keep America a land of opportunity,

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.880
where anyone – of any race, any religion,
from any background – can make it if they

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.770
try.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.570
Our country was born out of a desire to be
free, and every day since, it’s been protected

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.540
by our men and women in uniform – people
who believed so deeply in America, they were

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.140
willing to give their lives for it.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.229
We owe them so much.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.860
So this Memorial Day, we’ll gather together,
as Americans, to honor the fallen, with both

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.920
public ceremonies and private remembrances.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.189
And I hope all Americans will take a moment
this weekend to think of those who have died

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.759
in service to our nation.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.609
Say a prayer in their memories and for their
families.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:05.740
Lay a flower where they’ve come to rest.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.050
Reach out to service members, military families
or veterans in your community, or families

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.709
who have lost loved ones,

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.640
and let them know that their service and sacrifice
will never be forgotten.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.400
Most of all, let’s keep working to make
sure that our country upholds our sacred trust

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.150
to all who’ve served.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.610
In recent weeks, we’ve seen again how much
more our nation has to do to make sure all

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.700
our veterans get the care they deserve.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.940
As Commander in Chief, I believe that taking
care of our veterans and their families is

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.360
a sacred obligation.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.610
It’s been one of the causes of my presidency.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.060
And now that we’ve ended the war in Iraq,
and as our war in Afghanistan ends as well,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.690
we have to work even harder as a nation to
make sure all our veterans get the benefits

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.790
and opportunities they’ve earned.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.060
They’ve done their duty, and they ask nothing
more than that this country does ours – now

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.490
and for decades to come.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.070
Happy Memorial Day, everybody.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.270
May God watch over our fallen heroes.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.220
And may He continue to bless the United States
of America.
