00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:07.300
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.066
This week, Congress finished
up some important work before

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.066
heading home for the holidays.

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.433
For the first time in years,
both parties came together

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:17.934
in the spirit of compromise to
pass a budget - one that helps

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:21.266
chart our economic course
for the next two years.

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:24.000
This budget will unwind some
of the damaging cuts that have

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.367
threatened students and seniors
and held back our businesses.

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:30.667
It clears the path for critical
investments in the things that

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:33.500
grow our economy and
strengthen our middle class,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.533
like education and research.

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:39.333
And it will keep reducing our
deficits - at a time when we've

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:43.200
seen four years of the fastest
deficit reduction since the end

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.300
of World War II.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.166
Members of Congress also
voted to finally allow several

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:51.567
dedicated and well-qualified
public servants to do their jobs

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:55.000
for the American people - many
of whom waited months for

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.033
a simple yes-or-no vote.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:59.400
These are judges, cabinet
secretaries

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.166
and military leaders.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.867
They're men and women charged
with growing our economy,

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:07.633
keeping our homeland secure, and
making sure our housing system

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:11.533
and financial system work
for ordinary Americans.

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.867
So after a year of showdowns and
obstruction that only held back

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:19.000
our economy, we've been able to
break the logjam a bit over

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.734
the last few weeks.

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:23.567
It's a hopeful sign that we can
end the cycle of short-sighted,

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:26.767
crisis-driven decision-making
and actually work together

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:28.600
to get things done.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.800
And that's important.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.166
Because there's
plenty of work to do.

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.867
Right now, because Congress
failed to act before leaving

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:37.800
on vacation, more than one
million Americans are poised

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.467
to lose a vital source of income
just a few days after Christmas.

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:44.767
For many people who are
still looking for work,

00:01:44.767 --> 00:01:47.567
unemployment insurance is a
lifeline that can make

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:51.867
the difference between temporary
hardship or lasting catastrophe.

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:54.800
Instead of punishing these
families who can least afford it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.800
- especially now - Congress
should first restore that

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.333
lifeline immediately, then put
their entire focus on creating

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:04.700
more good jobs that
pay good wages.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.533
That's what I'll be
focused on next year,

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.133
and every day I have the
privilege

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:09.567
of being your President.

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:10.967
Growing the economy.

00:02:10.967 --> 00:02:12.600
Expanding opportunity.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.867
Building an America that offers
everyone who works hard the

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:20.433
chance to get ahead, and every
child a fair shot at success.

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:23.233
And if Congress continues to
act in the spirit of cooperation

00:02:23.233 --> 00:02:26.266
we've seen in recent weeks, I'm
confident we can make much more

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:29.700
progress together
in the year to come.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.567
Thanks.

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:33.467
And have a great weekend and
a very Merry Christmas.
