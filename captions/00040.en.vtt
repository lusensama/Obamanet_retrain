00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:12.278
The President: Happy
Fourth of July, everybody.

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:14.481
Like many of you, Michelle,
Sasha, Malia, and I are

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:17.217
going to spend the day
outdoors grilling burgers,

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:20.286
hot dogs, watching the
fireworks with our family

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.821
and friends.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.890
It's also Malia's birthday
which always makes the

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.792
Fourth extra fun for us.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.995
As always, we've invited
some very special guests to

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.698
our backyard barbeque,
several hundred members of

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:35.001
our military and
their families.

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.904
On this most American of
holidays, we remember that

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:41.207
all who serve here at home
and overseas represent what

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:44.577
today's all about, and we
remember that their families

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.613
serve, too.

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.515
We are so grateful for
their service and for

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:49.883
their sacrifice.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:53.253
We remember as well that
this is the day when 239

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:57.657
years ago, our founding
patriots declared our

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:01.127
independence, proclaiming
that all of us are created

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:04.164
equal, endowed by our
creator with certain

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:07.033
unalienable rights,
including the rights to

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:11.371
life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.773
A couple of centuries later,
we've made ourselves into a

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:17.010
big, bold, dynamic,
and diverse country.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.344
We're of all races.

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:19.712
We come from all places.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:22.749
We practice all faiths,
and believe in all sorts of

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.685
different ideas, but
our allegiance to this

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:29.255
declaration, this idea,
is the creed that

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.691
binds us together.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:34.727
It's what, out of
many, makes us one.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:37.230
And it's been the work of
each successive generation

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.300
to keep this founding creed
safe by making sure it's

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.003
words apply to every
single American.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:47.774
Folks have fought, marched,
protested, even died for

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:51.778
that endeavor, proving that
as Americans, our destiny is

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.180
not written for
us, but by us.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.183
We honor those heroes today.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.586
We honor everyone who
continually strives to make

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:03.323
this country a better,
stronger, more inclusive,

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.692
more hopeful place.

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:09.696
And we the people pledge to
make their task our own, to

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:11.998
secure the promise of our
founding words for our own

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:15.034
children, and our
children's children.

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:17.504
And finally, what better
weekend than this to cheer

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:19.739
on Team USA.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.673
Good luck to the U.S.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:24.344
Women's National Team
in the World Cup Final.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:25.478
Thanks, everybody!

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:28.548
From my family to yours,
have a safe and happy

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:31.484
Fourth of July!
