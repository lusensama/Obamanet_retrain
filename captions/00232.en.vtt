00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:08.233
The President:
Today, there's a debate going on
in Washington over the best way

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:11.700
to get America's fiscal house in
order and get our economy on a

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.166
stronger footing going forward.

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.200
For a decade, America has been
spending more money than we've

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.600
taken in.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.000
And for several decades,
our debt has been rising.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.934
Let's be honest -- neither
party in this town is blameless.

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:28.767
Both have talked this problem
to death without doing enough

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:29.867
about it.

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:32.633
That's what drives people
nuts about Washington.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:35.633
Too often, it's a place more
concerned with playing politics

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:39.266
and serving special interests
than resolving real problems or

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:43.100
focusing on what you're
facing in your own lives.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.000
But right now, we have
a responsibility --

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.133
and an opportunity -- to reduce
our deficit as much as possible

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.800
and solve this problem in a
real and comprehensive way.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.667
Simply put, it will take
a balanced approach,

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:59.967
shared sacrifice, and a
willingness to make unpopular

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:02.500
choices on all our parts.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.133
That means spending less
on domestic programs.

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.700
It means spending less
on defense programs.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.367
It means reforming programs like
Medicare to reduce costs and

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:14.533
strengthen the program
for future generations.

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.400
And it means taking
on the tax code,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.900
and cutting out certain tax
breaks and deductions for the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.767
wealthiest Americans.

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:23.700
Now, some of these things
don't make folks in my party

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.834
too happy.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:27.300
And I wouldn't agree to some
of these cuts if we were in a

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.533
better fiscal situation,
but we're not.

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.500
That's why I'm
willing to compromise.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.734
I'm willing to do what it
takes to solve this problem,

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:37.233
even if it's not
politically popular.

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:40.433
And I expect leaders in Congress
to show that same willingness

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.033
to compromise.

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:45.333
The truth is, you can't
solve our deficit without

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.767
cutting spending.

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:49.233
But you also can't solve it
without asking the wealthiest

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:51.800
Americans to pay
their fair share --

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.600
or without taking on loopholes
that give special interests and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.467
big corporations tax
breaks that middle-class

00:01:57.467 --> 00:01:59.767
Americans don't get.

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:01.433
It's pretty simple.

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:03.734
I don't think oil companies
should keep getting special tax

00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:07.233
breaks when they're making
tens of billions in profits.

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:10.166
I don't think hedge fund
managers should pay taxes at a

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:12.834
lower rate than
their secretaries.

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:16.266
And I don't think it's fair to
ask nothing of someone like me

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:19.100
when the average family has seen
their income decline over the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.266
past decade -- and when many of
you are just trying to stretch

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:25.767
every dollar as
far as it will go.

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:28.233
We shouldn't put the burden of
deficit reduction on the backs

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:31.367
of folks who've already borne
the brunt of the recession.

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:33.734
It's not reasonable
and it's not right.

00:02:33.734 --> 00:02:35.633
If we're going to ask
seniors, or students,

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:38.333
or middle-class
Americans to sacrifice,

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:41.266
then we have to ask corporations
and the wealthiest Americans to

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:43.200
share in that sacrifice.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.900
We have to ask everyone
to play their part.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.367
Because we are all part
of the same country.

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:50.967
We're all in this together.

00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:53.233
So I've put things on the table
that are important to me and to

00:02:53.233 --> 00:02:55.900
Democrats, and I expect
Republican leaders to

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.500
do the same.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.433
After all, we've worked
together like that before.

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:03.100
Ronald Reagan worked with Tip
O'Neill and Democrats to cut

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.900
spending, raise revenues,
and reform Social Security.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.667
Bill Clinton worked with Newt
Gingrich and Republicans to

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.667
balance the budget
and create surpluses.

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:15.734
Nobody ever got
everything they wanted.

00:03:15.734 --> 00:03:18.166
But eventually, they
worked together.

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:20.500
And they moved this
country forward.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.667
That kind of cooperation should
be the least you expect from us

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:25.700
-- not the most
you expect from us.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.333
You work hard, you
do what's right,

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:31.400
and you expect leaders
who do the same.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.333
You sent us to Washington
to do the tough things.

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:35.734
The right things.

00:03:35.734 --> 00:03:39.300
Not just for some of
us, but for all of us.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.100
Not just what's enough to get
through the next election --

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.100
but what's right for
the next generation.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.200
You expect us to get this right.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.266
To put America back on
firm economic ground.

00:03:50.266 --> 00:03:52.633
To forge a healthy,
growing economy.

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:56.667
To create new jobs and rebuild
the lives of the middle class.

00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:59.033
And that's what I'm
committed to doing.

00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:00.166
Thanks.
