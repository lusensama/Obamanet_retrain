The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.658 --> 00:00:10.191
This Sunday is Father's Day, and
so I wanted to take a moment

00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:13.858
to talk about the most important
job many of us will ever have -

00:00:13.858 --> 00:00:16.191
and that's being a dad.

00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:18.858
Today we're blessed to live in a
world where technology allows

00:00:18.858 --> 00:00:23.024
us to connect instantly with
just about anyone on the planet.

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:25.692
But no matter how advanced
we get, there will never

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:29.825
be a substitute for the love and
support and, most importantly,

00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:33.458
the presence of a parent
in a child's life.

00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:37.858
And in many ways, that's
uniquely true for fathers.

00:00:37.858 --> 00:00:39.958
I never really
knew my own father.

00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.858
I was raised by a single mom and
two wonderful grandparents who

00:00:42.858 --> 00:00:45.825
made incredible
sacrifices for me.

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:48.158
And there are single parents like my mom all across the

00:00:48.158 --> 00:00:52.958
country who do a heroic job
raising terrific kids.

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.491
But I still wish I had a dad
who was not only around, but

00:00:56.491 --> 00:01:00.291
involved; another role model
to teach me what my mom did her

00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:03.792
best to instill - values
like hard work and integrity;

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:07.091
responsibility and delayed
gratification - all the things

00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:09.991
that give a child the foundation
to envision a brighter

00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:12.325
future for themselves.

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:15.892
That's why I try every day to be
for Michelle and my girls what

00:01:15.892 --> 00:01:19.024
my father was not
for my mother and me.

00:01:19.024 --> 00:01:22.725
And I've met plenty of other
people - dads and uncles and men

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:24.991
without a family connection
- who are trying to break the

00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:29.692
cycle and give more of our young
people a strong male role model.

00:01:29.692 --> 00:01:32.658
Being a good parent - whether
you're gay or straight; a foster

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:35.625
parent or a grandparent
- isn't easy.

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:39.425
It demands your constant
attention, frequent sacrifice,

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:41.591
and of course a healthy dose of patience.

00:01:41.591 --> 00:01:43.091
And nobody's perfect.

00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:45.958
To this day, I'm still figuring
out how to be a better husband

00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:49.558
to my wife and
father to my kids.

00:01:49.558 --> 00:01:53.491
And I want to do what I can as
President to encourage strong

00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:55.558
marriage and strong families.

00:01:55.558 --> 00:01:57.825
We should reform our child
support laws to get more men

00:01:57.825 --> 00:02:00.725
working and engaged
with their children.

00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:03.158
And my Administration will
continue to work with the faith

00:02:03.158 --> 00:02:05.391
and other community
organizations, as well

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.425
as businesses, on a campaign to
encourage strong

00:02:08.425 --> 00:02:10.925
parenting and fatherhood.

00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:13.692
Because if there's one thing
I've learned along the way,

00:02:13.692 --> 00:02:16.792
it's that all our personal
successes shine a little less

00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:19.391
brightly if we fail at family.

00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:21.658
That's what matters most.

00:02:21.658 --> 00:02:23.692
When I look back on my life,
I won't be thinking about any

00:02:23.692 --> 00:02:27.458
particular legislation I
passed or policy I promoted.

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:28.925
I'll be thinking about Michelle,
and the journey

00:02:28.925 --> 00:02:30.825
we've been on together.

00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:33.358
I'll be thinking about Sasha's
dance recitals and Malia's

00:02:33.358 --> 00:02:36.458
tennis matches - about the
conversations we've had

00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:38.825
and the quiet moments we've shared.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.658
I'll be thinking about whether
I did right by them, and whether

00:02:41.658 --> 00:02:46.391
they knew, every day, just
how much they were loved.

00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:49.625
That's what I think about when I think about fatherhood.

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:52.525
And if we can do our best to
be a source of comfort and

00:02:52.525 --> 00:02:56.958
encouragement to our kids; if we
can show them unconditional love

00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.692
and help them grow into the
people they were

00:02:58.692 --> 00:03:02.625
meant to be; then we will
have succeeded.

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:05.158
Happy Father's Day to all the
dads out there,

00:03:05.158 --> 00:03:06.591
and have a great weekend.
