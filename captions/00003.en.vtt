00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.178
The President: Hello, everybody.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:15.382
One of America's greatest
strengths is our free market.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:18.618
A thriving private sector is
the lifeblood of our economy

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:21.020
- it's how we create jobs,
expand opportunities,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.490
and give everybody
a shot at success.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.394
It's what has made America
the strongest country on Earth.

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.529
The most essential
ingredient in a healthy free

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.831
market is competition.

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.033
But right now, too many
companies are engaging in

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:37.303
behaviors that stifle
competition - like blocking

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:39.606
new competitors from
entering the market or

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:42.609
limiting the information and
options that give consumers

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.344
real choice.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:47.280
As a consequence, the rest
of us pay higher prices for

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.783
lower quality
products and services.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.919
Workers receive lower wages
than they otherwise would.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.088
Small businesses and
entrepreneurs can get

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:56.990
squeezed out of the market.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.827
And none of that is fair -
or good for our economy.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.196
The deck should not be
stacked in favor of the

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.465
wealthiest individuals and
the biggest corporations,

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.333
against working Americans.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.936
That's why my administration
is doing everything we can

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:12.806
to reverse this trend and
promote more competition

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.374
in the marketplace.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:16.943
In addition to enforcing
the rules on the books,

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:19.512
I've directed federal
agencies to identify

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.582
anti-competitive behavior
in different industries,

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:26.953
and find new and specific
ways to promote competition.

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:30.356
One industry that's ripe
for change is cable TV.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:33.359
Right now, 99 percent of
cable and satellite TV

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.197
customers rent set-top
boxes from their providers.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.466
According to one survey,
this costs households an

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.902
average of more
than $230 per year.

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:46.573
We spend some $20 billion
to rent these devices.

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.875
While we have almost
unlimited choice in what we

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:52.045
watch on television, from
traditional programming to

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:55.448
online content, there's next
to no competition to build a

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.584
better, user-friendly
product that allows you to

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:00.887
easily access all this
content in one place.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:03.056
So most consumers just rent
whatever

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.791
the cable company offers.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.292
Because we have to.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.294
That means companies
have little incentive

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.295
to innovate.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.531
As a consequence, we need
multiple devices and

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:15.101
controllers to access
content from different sources.

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:16.970
That makes no sense.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.206
So my administration has
encouraged the FCC to remove

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:23.009
the barriers to competition
that prevent new players

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:27.113
from offering innovative
cable box options to consumers.

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:28.448
We know this works.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.517
For years, Americans had to
rent our telephones

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:32.185
from the phone company.

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:34.420
This was a while ago,
but when the FCC finally

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.056
unlocked competition
for home phones,

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.659
the marketplace was flooded
with all kinds of phone

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.129
options with new features,
and at different price points.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.265
Consumers suddenly
had many options.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:48.535
And the whole industry
moved forward as a result.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.537
The same can happen
with cable boxes,

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:53.506
and in dozens of areas of
our economy - all of which

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.709
can make a difference
in your everyday life.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.178
The bottom line is,
competition is good for

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:02.448
consumers, workers,
businesses, and our economy.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:04.450
So I'm going to keep doing
everything I can to make

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.520
sure that our free market
works for everyone.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.522
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
