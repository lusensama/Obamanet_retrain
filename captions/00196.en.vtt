00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.800
The President:
For millions of Americans, this
weekend is a time to celebrate

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.166
redemption at God's hand.

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.734
Tonight, Jews will gather
for a second Seder,

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:16.700
where they will retell
the story of the Exodus.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.400
And tomorrow, my family will
join Christians around the world

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.734
as we thank God for the
all-important gift of grace

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:25.166
through the
resurrection of His son,

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:28.467
and experience the
wonder of Easter morning.

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:31.100
These holidays have their roots
in miracles that took place

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.133
thousands of years ago.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.333
They connect us to our past
and give us strength as we face

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.867
the future.

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:40.266
And they remind us of the
common thread of humanity that

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.734
connects us all.

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:44.367
For me, and for countless
other Christians,

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:48.066
Easter weekend is a time
to reflect and rejoice.

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:51.200
Yesterday, many of us took a few
quiet moments to try and fathom

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.633
the tremendous sacrifice
Jesus made for all of us.

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.200
Tomorrow, we will celebrate the
resurrection of a savior who

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.400
died so that we might live.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.433
And throughout
these sacred days,

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:04.700
we recommit ourselves to
following His example.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.667
We rededicate our time
on Earth to selflessness,

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.500
and to loving our neighbors.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.133
We remind ourselves that
no matter who we are,

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:15.667
or how much we achieve, we
each stand humbled before an

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:17.266
almighty God.

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:20.066
The story of Christ's triumph
over death holds special meaning

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.567
for Christians.

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:25.166
But all of us, no matter
how or whether we believe,

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:28.633
can identify with
elements of His story.

00:01:28.633 --> 00:01:31.133
The triumph of
hope over despair.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.400
Of faith over doubt.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.333
The notion that there is
something out there that is

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:38.000
bigger than ourselves.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.700
These beliefs help unite
Americans of all faiths

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.300
and backgrounds.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.734
They shape our values
and guide our work.

00:01:45.734 --> 00:01:48.433
They put our lives
in perspective.

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:50.900
So to all Christians celebrating
the Resurrection with us,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.467
Michelle and I want to wish you
a blessed and Happy Easter.

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:58.567
And to all Americans, I hope you
have a weekend filled with joy

00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:03.000
and reflection, focused on
the things that matter most.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.767
God bless you, and may God bless
the United States of America.
