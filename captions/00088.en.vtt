00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:11.169
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.071
I hope you're enjoying your Fourth of July weekend.

00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:16.240
I want to begin today by
saying a special word

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.477
to the U.S. Men's Soccer
Team, who represented America

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:22.046
so well the past few weeks.

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:23.848
We are so proud of you.

00:00:23.848 --> 00:00:26.084
You've got a lot
of new believers.

00:00:26.084 --> 00:00:28.086
And I know there's actually a
petition on the White House

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:31.856
website to make Tim Howard the
next Secretary of Defense.

00:00:31.856 --> 00:00:33.858
Chuck Hagel's got
that spot right now,

00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:38.029
but if there is a vacancy,
I promise to think about it.

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:40.998
It was 238 years ago that
our founders came together

00:00:40.998 --> 00:00:44.502
in Philadelphia to launch
our American experiment.

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:46.671
There were farmers
and businessmen,

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:52.443
doctors and lawyers, ministers
and a kite-flying scientist.

00:00:52.443 --> 00:00:55.213
Those early patriots may have
come from different backgrounds

00:00:55.213 --> 00:00:56.347
and different walks of life.

00:00:56.347 --> 00:01:00.651
But they were united by a belief
in a simple truth -- that we are

00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:04.655
all created equal; that we are
all endowed by our Creator with

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:08.059
certain inalienable rights;
and that among these rights

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:12.363
are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness.

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:14.499
Over the years, that belief
has sustained us through

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:18.536
war and depression;
peace and prosperity.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.638
It's helped us build the
strongest democracy,

00:01:20.638 --> 00:01:23.608
the greatest middle class, and
the most powerful military

00:01:23.608 --> 00:01:24.609
the world has ever known.

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.746
And today, there isn't a nation
on Earth that wouldn't gladly

00:01:28.746 --> 00:01:31.716
trade places with the
United States of America.

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:34.018
But our success is only
possible because we have never

00:01:34.018 --> 00:01:37.722
treated those self-evident
truths as self-executing.

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:41.993
Generations of Americans have
marched, organized, petitioned,

00:01:41.993 --> 00:01:45.730
fought and even died to extend
those rights to others;

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.900
to widen the circle of
opportunity for others;

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.303
and to perfect this
union we love so much.

00:01:52.303 --> 00:01:54.472
That's why I want to say a
special thanks to the men

00:01:54.472 --> 00:01:56.908
and women of our armed
forces and the families who

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:59.410
serve with them -- especially
those service members

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.113
who spent this most American
of holidays serving your

00:02:02.113 --> 00:02:04.248
country far from home.

00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:07.118
You keep us safe, and you keep
the United States of America

00:02:07.118 --> 00:02:09.587
a shining beacon of
hope for the world.

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:11.823
And for that, you and
your families deserve not

00:02:11.823 --> 00:02:14.392
only the appreciation of
a grateful nation,

00:02:14.392 --> 00:02:16.694
but our enduring commitment
to serve you as well

00:02:16.694 --> 00:02:18.963
as you've served us.

00:02:18.963 --> 00:02:19.964
God bless you all.

00:02:19.964 --> 00:02:20.965
And have a great weekend.
