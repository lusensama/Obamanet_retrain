00:00:05.525 --> 00:00:09.725
The President:
This week in Libya, we lost
four of our fellow Americans.

00:00:09.725 --> 00:00:13.124
Glen Doherty, Tyrone
Woods, Sean Smith,

00:00:13.124 --> 00:00:16.158
and Chris Stevens were all
killed in an outrageous attack

00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:19.058
on our diplomatic
post in Benghazi.

00:00:19.058 --> 00:00:22.658
These four Americans represented
the very best of our country.

00:00:22.658 --> 00:00:25.825
Glen and Tyrone had each served
America as Navy SEALs for many

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.758
years, before continuing their
service providing security for

00:00:28.758 --> 00:00:30.858
our diplomats in Libya.

00:00:30.858 --> 00:00:32.892
They died as they
lived their lives --

00:00:32.892 --> 00:00:34.558
defending their
fellow Americans,

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:37.958
and advancing the values
that all of us hold dear.

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.458
Sean also started his service
in uniform, in the Air Force.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.858
He then spent years at
the State Department,

00:00:43.858 --> 00:00:47.692
on several continents, always
answering his country's call.

00:00:47.692 --> 00:00:51.792
And Ambassador Chris Stevens
died a hero in two countries --

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:54.658
here in the United States, where
he inspired those of us who knew

00:00:54.658 --> 00:00:58.725
him; and in Libya, a country
that he helped to save,

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.858
where he ultimately
laid down his life.

00:01:01.858 --> 00:01:04.491
On Friday, I was able to tell
their families how much the

00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:07.258
American people
appreciated their service.

00:01:07.258 --> 00:01:10.458
Without people like them,
America could not sustain the

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:13.725
freedoms we enjoy, the
security we demand,

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:17.058
and the leadership that
the entire world counts on.

00:01:17.058 --> 00:01:20.458
As we mourn their loss, we must
also send a clear and resolute

00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:23.991
message to the world: those who
attack our people will find no

00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:25.758
escape from justice.

00:01:25.758 --> 00:01:27.725
We will not waver
in their pursuit.

00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:30.458
And we will never allow anyone
to shake the resolve of the

00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:32.925
United States of America.

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:36.091
This tragic attack takes place
at a time of turmoil and protest

00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:37.792
in many different countries.

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:40.325
I've made it clear that the
United States has a profound

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:43.091
respect for people
of all faiths.

00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:45.391
We stand for religious freedom.

00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:48.224
And we reject the denigration
of any religion --

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:50.491
including Islam.

00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:54.058
But there is never any
justification for violence.

00:01:54.058 --> 00:01:55.958
There is no religion that
condones the targeting of

00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.825
innocent men and women.

00:01:57.825 --> 00:02:00.958
There is no excuse for attacks
on our Embassies and Consulates.

00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.058
And so long as I am
Commander-in-Chief,

00:02:03.058 --> 00:02:05.792
the United States will never
tolerate efforts to harm our

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.925
fellow Americans.

00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:10.525
Right now, we are doing whatever
we can to protect Americans who

00:02:10.525 --> 00:02:12.024
are serving abroad.

00:02:12.024 --> 00:02:14.358
We're in contact with
governments around the globe,

00:02:14.358 --> 00:02:18.124
to strengthen our cooperation,
and underscore that every nation

00:02:18.124 --> 00:02:21.625
has a responsibility to
help us protect our people.

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:24.191
We've moved forward with an
effort to see that justice is

00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:27.191
done for those we lost, and
we will not rest until that

00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:29.158
work is done.

00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:33.091
Most of all, we must reaffirm
that we will carry on the work

00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:34.958
of our fallen heroes.

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.858
I know the images on our
televisions are disturbing.

00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:40.491
But let us never forget
that for every angry mob,

00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:42.991
there are millions who yearn
for the freedom and dignity

00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:45.325
and hope that our
flag represents.

00:02:45.325 --> 00:02:48.591
That's the cause of America --
the ideals that took root in our

00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:52.425
founding; the opportunity that
drew so many to our shores;

00:02:52.425 --> 00:02:55.024
and the awesome progress
that we have promoted all

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:56.925
across the globe.

00:02:56.925 --> 00:02:58.491
We are Americans.

00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:00.558
We know that our spirit
cannot be broken,

00:03:00.558 --> 00:03:03.892
and the foundation of our
leadership cannot be shaken.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:07.191
That is the legacy of the
four Americans we lost --

00:03:07.191 --> 00:03:10.024
men who will live on in the
hearts of those they loved,

00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:13.191
and the strength of the
country they served.

00:03:13.191 --> 00:03:14.558
So with their
memory to guide us,

00:03:14.558 --> 00:03:17.792
we will carry forward the work
of making our country stronger,

00:03:17.792 --> 00:03:20.658
our citizens safer, and
the world a better and more

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:22.558
hopeful place.

00:03:22.558 --> 00:03:23.558
Thanks.
