00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.145
The President: Hi
everybody, this week,

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.315
we remained focused on
our fight against Ebola.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.585
In Dallas, dozens of family,
friends and others who had

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.654
been in close contact with the
first patient, Mr. Duncan,

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:24.057
were declared free of
Ebola-a reminder that

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:27.060
this disease is actually
very hard to catch.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.463
Across Dallas, others being
monitored-including health care

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.665
workers who were most
at risk-were also

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:35.168
declared Ebola-free.

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:38.071
Two Americans-patients in
Georgia and Nebraska who

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.741
contracted the disease in West
Africa-recovered and were

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.576
released from the hospital.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:46.546
The first of the two Dallas
nurses who were diagnosed-Nina

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.916
Pham-was declared Ebola free,
and yesterday I was proud to

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:53.486
welcome her to the Oval Office
and give her a big hug.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.588
The other nurse-Amber
Vinson-continues

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:57.157
to improve as well.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:59.993
And in Africa, the countries
of Senegal and Nigeria

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:02.662
were declared free of
Ebola-a reminder that

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:04.764
this disease can be
contained and defeated.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.368
In New York City, medical
personnel moved quickly

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:11.304
to isolate and care for the
patient there-a doctor

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:13.840
who recently returned
from West Africa.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.842
The city and state of New York
have strong public health

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:18.845
systems, and they've been
preparing for this possibility.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:21.414
Because of the steps we've
taken in recent weeks,

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.950
our CDC experts were
already at the hospital,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.953
helping staff prepare for
this kind of situation.

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:29.222
Before the patient
was even diagnosed,

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:32.659
we deployed one of our new
CDC rapid response teams.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.929
And I've assured Governor Cuomo
and Mayor de Blasio that they'll

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.332
have all the federal support
they need as they go forward.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:42.769
More broadly, this week we
continued to step up our efforts

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.504
across the country.

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:47.540
New CDC guidelines and outreach
is helping hospitals improve

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.243
training and protect their
health care workers.

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:52.245
The Defense Department's
new team of doctors,

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:55.114
nurses and trainers will respond
quickly if called upon to help.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:58.852
New travel measures are now
directing all travelers from

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:01.287
the three affected countries in
West Africa into five

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:04.991
U.S. airports where we're
conducting additional screening.

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:07.861
Starting this week, these
travelers will be required

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:11.231
to report their temperatures
and any symptoms on a daily

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:15.735
basis-for 21 days until we're
confident they don't have Ebola.

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:18.304
Here at the White House, my new
Ebola response coordinator

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.773
is working to ensure a
seamless response across

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:22.208
the federal government.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.711
And we have been examining the
protocols for protecting our

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:28.147
brave health care workers,
and, guided by the science,

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:30.717
we'll continue to work with
state and local officials

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:33.820
to take the necessary steps to
ensure the safety and health

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.922
of the American people.

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:39.292
In closing, I want to leave
you with some basic facts.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:42.629
First, you cannot
get Ebola easily.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.932
You can't get it through
casual contact with someone.

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:49.402
Remember, down in Dallas, even
Mr. Duncan's family-who lived

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:53.039
with him and helped care for
him-even they did not get Ebola.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:57.110
The only way you can get this
disease is by coming into direct

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.047
contact with the bodily fluids
of someone with symptoms.

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:02.482
That's the science.

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:04.484
Those are the facts.

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.486
Sadly, Mr. Duncan
did not survive,

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:09.622
and we continue to keep
his family in our prayers.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.492
At the same time, it's important
to remember that of the seven

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:16.396
Americans treated so far for
Ebola-the five who contracted

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:19.899
it in West Africa, plus the
two nurses from Dallas-all

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.268
seven have survived.

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:24.270
Let me say that again-seven
Americans treated;

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.271
all seven survived.

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:30.176
I've had two of them
in the Oval Office.

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:32.712
And now we're focused on
making sure the patient

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:36.215
in New York receives
the best care as well.

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:37.917
Here's the bottom line.

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:40.019
Patients can beat
this disease.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.321
And we can beat
this disease.

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.256
But we have to
stay vigilant.

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:45.224
We have to work together
at every level-federal,

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:46.859
state and local.

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.495
And we have to keep leading
the global response,

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:51.464
because the best way
to stop this disease,

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:53.733
the best way to
keep Americans safe,

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:57.971
is to stop it at its
source-in West Africa.

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:01.507
And we have to be guided by the
science-we have to be guided

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:04.477
by the facts, not fear.

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:07.313
Yesterday, New Yorkers
showed us the way.

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:09.816
They did what they do every
day-jumping on buses,

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:13.620
riding the subway, crowding into
elevators, heading into work,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.555
gathering in parks.

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:18.625
That spirit-that determination
to carry on-is part of what

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.627
makes New York one of the
great cities in the world.

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:24.864
And that's the spirit all of us
can draw upon, as Americans,

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:26.532
as we meet this
challenge together.
