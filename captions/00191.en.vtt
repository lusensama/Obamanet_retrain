00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:07.667
The President:
We all know the past few
years have been difficult for

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:08.967
this country.

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:11.333
After the worst recession
of our lifetimes,

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.667
it's going to take longer than
any of us would like for the

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:15.567
economy to fully recover.

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:18.166
But there are plenty of
steps we can take to speed up

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.467
the recovery.

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:21.667
There are things we
can do -- right now --

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:24.700
to help create jobs and restore
some of the financial security

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.333
that so many families have lost.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.600
Now, the other side
isn't so optimistic.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.834
They think all we can
do is cut taxes --

00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:33.767
especially for the
wealthiest Americans --

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.734
and go back to letting banks
and corporations write their own

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:37.734
rules again.

00:00:37.734 --> 00:00:39.667
That's their plan.

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:41.500
But I think they're wrong.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.033
We tried their ideas
for nearly a decade,

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:47.266
and it didn't work out so well.

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.367
We can't go back to the
same policies that got us

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:50.367
into this mess.

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:51.934
We've got to move forward.

00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:54.066
We need to build an
economy where hard work and

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:57.834
responsibility are rewarded --
where you can find a good job,

00:00:57.834 --> 00:01:00.767
own your own home,
maybe start a business,

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:04.000
and give your kids the
chance to do even better.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.200
That's where we need to go.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.266
And I've been pushing Congress
to help us get there by passing

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:11.667
a few common-sense policies
that would make a difference.

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:14.100
Democrats and Republicans have
already done some important work

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.767
together -- from passing
tax cuts for workers,

00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:19.266
to opening up new markets
for American products,

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.400
to reforming our patent system.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.633
But now we need to do more.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:26.166
That's why we made Congress
a handy "To-Do" list --

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.533
just like the kind
I get from Michelle.

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.934
It's short, but each of the
ideas on this list will help

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:36.500
create jobs and build a
stronger economy right now.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.433
First, Congress should stop
giving tax breaks to companies

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:42.700
that ship jobs overseas, and
use that money to cover moving

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.033
expenses for companies that
bring jobs back to America.

00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:50.433
Second, Congress should help the
millions of Americans who have

00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:53.100
worked hard and made their
mortgage payments on time

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.734
refinance their mortgages at
lower rates and save at least

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:59.500
$3,000 a year.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.767
Third, Congress should help
small business owners by giving

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:05.734
them a tax break for hiring
more workers and paying them

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:07.100
higher wages.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.400
Small businesses are the
engine of economic growth in

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.700
this country.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.433
We shouldn't be
holding them back --

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:15.533
we should be making it
easier for them to succeed.

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:17.734
Fourth, if Congress
fails to act soon,

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:20.767
clean energy companies will see
their taxes go up and could be

00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:22.900
forced to lay off employees.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.600
These companies are putting
Americans to work and helping

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.800
break our dependence
on foreign oil.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.266
Congress should extend
these tax credits.

00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:34.033
And finally, Congress should
help our veterans returning from

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:38.200
Iraq and Afghanistan by
creating a Veterans Job Corps.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.367
Our men and women in uniform
have served this country

00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:41.767
with honor.

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:44.200
Now it's our turn to serve them.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.400
So that's Congress's
"To-Do" List.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.467
But now we need them to
start crossing things off.

00:02:49.467 --> 00:02:51.834
I need you to call your
Members of Congress,

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:56.133
write them an email, tweet, and
let them know we can't afford to

00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:58.934
wait any longer to
get things done.

00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:02.533
Tell them now is the time to
take steps we know will grow our

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:05.567
economy and create jobs.

00:03:05.567 --> 00:03:06.900
You're working harder.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.133
You're meeting your
responsibilities.

00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:12.500
And your representatives in
Washington should do the same.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.533
Let's push Congress
to do the right thing.

00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:18.467
Let's keep moving this
country forward together.

00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:20.567
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
