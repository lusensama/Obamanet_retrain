00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:07.066
The President:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.700
Earlier this week, I spent some
time with the hardworking men

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.767
and women of the
American auto industry,

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:15.000
who are busy writing a new
chapter in America's story.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.934
Just a few years ago, their
industry was shedding hundreds

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:19.767
of thousands of jobs.

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:22.567
Two of the Big Three
-- GM and Chrysler --

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:24.633
were on the brink of failure.

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:27.667
If we had let this great
American industry collapse --

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:30.233
if we had let Detroit
go bankrupt --

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:33.066
more than one million Americans
would have lost their jobs in

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.100
the middle of the worst
recession since the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.900
Great Depression.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.967
I refused to let that happen.

00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:41.400
These jobs are worth more
than just a paycheck --

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.633
they're a source of pride and
a ticket to the middle class.

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:48.900
These companies are worth more
than just the cars they build --

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.600
they're a symbol of American
innovation and a source of our

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.900
manufacturing might.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.066
So in exchange for help,
we demanded responsibility.

00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.133
We got the companies to
retool and restructure.

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.967
Everyone sacrificed.

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:06.967
And three years later, the
American auto industry is back.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:10.667
Today, GM is the number
one automaker in the world.

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.033
Chrysler is growing faster
in America than any other

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:14.533
car company.

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.800
Ford is investing billions in
American plants and factories,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.333
and plans to bring
thousands of jobs back home.

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:25.000
All told, the entire industry
has added more than 200,000 new

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.734
jobs over the past
two and a half years.

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:29.066
And they're not just
building cars again --

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.433
they're building better cars.

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:34.500
Thanks to new fuel efficiency
standards we put in place,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.567
they're building cars that will
average nearly 55 miles per

00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:40.367
gallon by the middle
of the next decade.

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.367
That's almost double
what they get today.

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:46.066
That means folks will be able to
fill up every two weeks instead

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:49.900
of every week, saving the
typical family more than $8,000

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.300
at the pump over time.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.600
That's a big deal, especially as
families are yet again feeling

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.066
the pinch from
rising gas prices.

00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:00.734
So what's happening in Detroit
will make a difference.

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.667
But it won't solve everything.

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:05.533
There's no silver bullet for
avoiding spikes in gas prices

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:06.700
every year.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.500
There's no shortcut to taking
control of our energy future.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.633
We have to pursue an
all-of-the-above strategy that

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.667
helps develop every
source of American energy.

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:19.000
And we have to do it now.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.367
The good news is, we've
been making progress.

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:24.000
Here -- take a
look at this chart.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.800
Six years ago, 60% of the
oil we used was imported.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.133
Since I took office, America's
dependence on foreign oil has

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:35.033
decreased every single year.

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:38.500
In fact, in 2010, for the
first time in 13 years,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.166
less than half the petroleum
we consumed was imported.

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:46.166
Part of that's because we're
producing more oil here at home

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:49.033
than at any time in
the last eight years.

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:52.033
But we can't just drill our
way out of this problem.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:54.333
While we consume 20%
of the world's oil,

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:57.867
we only have 2% of the
world's oil reserves.

00:02:57.867 --> 00:03:00.333
We've got to develop new
technologies that will help us

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:02.900
use new forms of energy.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.100
That's been a priority
of mine as President.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.667
And because of the investments
we've made, our use of clean,

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:11.433
renewable energy has
nearly doubled --

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:15.233
and thousands of Americans
have jobs because of it.

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:16.834
Now we need to keep at it.

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:20.066
And to do that, we need
to make the right choices.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:22.667
Here's one choice we
can make right now.

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:26.533
Every year, $4 billion of your
tax dollars goes to subsidizing

00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:28.600
the oil industry.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.734
These are the same companies
making record profits --

00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:34.500
tens of billions
of dollars a year.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.166
I don't think oil companies
need more corporate welfare.

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:41.300
Congress should end
this taxpayer giveaway.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.400
If you agree with me, I'm
asking you to email, call,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.600
or tweet your representative.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.066
Tell them to stop fighting
for oil companies.

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:52.567
And tell them to start
fighting for working families.

00:03:52.567 --> 00:03:54.867
Tell them to fight for the
clean energy future that's

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:56.433
within our reach.

00:03:56.433 --> 00:03:58.633
Because the sooner
we all get started,

00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:01.934
the sooner we'll
get there together.

00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:03.633
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
