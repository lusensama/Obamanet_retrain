00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:08.500
The President:
This week, Americans across the country cast their votes and

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.367
made their voices heard.

00:00:10.367 --> 00:00:12.367
And your message was clear.

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:16.166
You're rightly frustrated with
the pace of our economic recovery.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.767
So am I.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:21.633
You're fed up with partisan
politics and want results.

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:23.400
I do too.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.100
So I congratulate all this week's winners --

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.467
Republicans, Democrats, and
Independents.

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:32.567
But now, the campaign season is
over.

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:35.567
And it's time to focus on our
shared responsibilities to work

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:39.033
together and deliver those
results: speeding up our

00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:41.967
economic recovery, creating
jobs,

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:44.233
and strengthening the middle
class so that the American Dream

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:47.333
feels like it's back within
reach.

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:50.767
That's why I've asked to sit
down soon with leaders of both

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:54.066
parties so that we can have an
extended discussion about what

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:57.533
we can do together to move this
country forward.

00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:00.166
And over the next few weeks,
we're going to have a chance to

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:04.266
work together in the brief
upcoming session of Congress.

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:07.433
Here's why this lame-duck session is so important.

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:10.500
Early in the last decade,
President Bush and Congress

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.367
enacted a series of tax cuts
that were designed to expire at

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:16.166
the end of this year.

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:20.100
What that means is, if Congress
doesn't act by New Year's Eve,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.934
middle-class families will see
their taxes go up starting on

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:25.667
New Year's Day.

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:30.066
But the last thing we should do
is raise taxes on middle-class families.

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.400
For the past decade, they saw
their costs rise,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.900
their incomes fall, and too many
jobs go overseas.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.066
They're the ones bearing the
brunt of the recession.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.734
They're the ones having trouble
making ends meet.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.900
They're the ones who need
relief right now.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.767
So something's got to be done.

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:50.834
And I believe there's room for
us to compromise and get it done together.

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:52.700
Let's start where we agree.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.734
All of us want certainty for
middle-class Americans.

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:59.967
None of us want them to wake up
on January 1st with a higher tax bill.

00:01:59.967 --> 00:02:02.266
And that's why I believe we should permanently extend the

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:07.166
Bush tax cuts for all families making less than $250,000 a year.

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:10.533
That's 98% of the American
people.

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:13.233
We also agree on the need to
start cutting spending and

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.333
bringing down our deficit.

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:18.633
That's going to require everyone
to make some tough choices.

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:22.266
In fact, if Congress were to
implement my proposal to freeze

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:25.734
non-security discretionary
spending for three years,

00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:28.433
it would bring this spending
down to its lowest level as a

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:31.867
share of the economy in 50
years.

00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:34.700
But at a time when we're going
to ask folks across the board to

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.367
make such difficult sacrifices,
I don't see how we can afford to

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:42.600
borrow an additional $700
billion from other countries to

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.834
make all the Bush tax cuts
permanent,

00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:48.033
even for the wealthiest 2% of
Americans.

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:51.700
We'd be digging ourselves into
an even deeper fiscal hole and

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.500
passing the burden on to our
children.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500
I recognize that both parties
are going to have to work

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.934
together and compromise to get
something done here.

00:02:59.934 --> 00:03:03.033
But I want to make my priorities
clear from the start.

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:06.400
One: middle class families need
permanent tax relief.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.166
And two: I believe we can't
afford to borrow and spend

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:12.800
another $700 billion on
permanent tax cuts for

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.333
millionaires and billionaires.

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:17.667
There are new public servants in
Washington,

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:20.266
but we still face the same
challenges.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.900
And you made it clear that it's
time for results.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.166
This a great opportunity to show
everyone that we got the message

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:29.233
and that we're willing, in this
post-election season,

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:33.533
to come together and do what's
best for the country we all love.

00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:34.567
Thanks.
