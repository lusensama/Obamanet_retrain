00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.478
The President: Today, I
want to take a few minutes

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:15.315
to speak with you-directly
and clearly-about Ebola:

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.051
what we're doing about it,
and what you need to know.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.786
Because meeting a
public health challenge

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:23.022
like this isn't just
a job for government.

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:27.494
All of us-citizens,
leaders, the media-have

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.796
a responsibility
and a role to play.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:34.300
This is a serious disease, but
we can't give in to hysteria

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.103
or fear-because that only
makes it harder to get

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:39.839
people the accurate
information they need.

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.041
We have to be guided
by the science.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:45.545
We have to remember
the basic facts.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:49.048
First, what we're seeing
now is not an "outbreak"

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:52.719
or an "epidemic" of
Ebola in America.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.822
We're a nation of more
than 300 million people.

00:00:55.822 --> 00:01:01.100
To date, we've seen three
cases of Ebola diagnosed here -

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.962
the man who contracted
the disease in Liberia,

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:06.833
came here and sadly died; the
two courageous nurses who

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:09.035
were infected while
they were treating him.

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:11.204
Our thoughts and our
prayers are with them,

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.206
and we're doing everything
we can to give them

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.374
the best care possible.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.445
Now, even one
infection is too many.

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:21.614
At the same time, we have to
keep this in perspective.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.416
As our public health
experts point out,

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:28.121
every year thousands of
Americans die from the flu.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:33.560
Second, Ebola is actually a
difficult disease to catch.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.763
It's not transmitted through
the air like the flu.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.699
You cannot get it from just
riding on a plane or a bus.

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:43.269
The only way that a person
can contract the disease

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.506
is by coming into direct
contact with the bodily fluids

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:50.109
of somebody who is
already showing symptoms.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.111
I've met and hugged
some of the doctors

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.014
and nurses who've
treated Ebola patients.

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.584
I've met with an Ebola
patient who recovered,

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.118
right in the
Oval Office.

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.354
And I'm fine.

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:05.124
Third, we know how to
fight this disease.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.826
We know the protocols.

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:10.363
And we know that when
they're followed, they work.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:13.399
So far, five Americans who
got infected with Ebola

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.802
in West Africa have
been brought back

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.771
to the United States-and
all five have been treated

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:22.408
safely, without infecting
healthcare workers.

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:23.977
And this week,
at my direction,

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.346
we're stepping
up our efforts.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.448
Additional CDC personnel
are on the scene

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.450
in Dallas and Cleveland.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.253
We're working quickly to track
and monitor anyone who may

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:36.789
have been in close contact
with someone showing symptoms.

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.225
We're sharing lessons
learned so other hospitals

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:42.729
don't repeat the mistakes
that happened in Dallas.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.398
The CDC's new Ebola rapid
response teams will deploy

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:49.035
quickly to help hospitals
implement the right protocols.

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:51.437
New screening measures are
now in place at airports

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:53.439
that receive nearly all
passengers arriving

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.676
from Liberia, Guinea
and Sierra Leone.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:59.012
And we'll continue to
constantly review our measures,

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.514
and update them as needed,
to make sure we're

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:05.518
doing everything we can
to keep Americans safe.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.788
Finally, we can't just
cut ourselves off from

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:12.258
West Africa, where this
disease is raging.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:14.894
Our medical experts tell us
that the best way to stop this

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:18.631
disease is to stop it at its
source-before it spreads

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:22.435
even wider and becomes even
more difficult to contain.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:25.338
Trying to seal off an entire
region of the world-if that were

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:28.875
even possible-could actually
make the situation worse.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.044
It would make it harder
to move health workers

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:33.112
and supplies
back and forth.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:35.582
Experience shows that it
could also cause people

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:38.918
in the affected region to
change their travel, to evade

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:43.089
screening, and make the
disease even harder to track.

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:45.325
So the United States will
continue to help lead

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:47.961
the global response
in West Africa.

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.763
Because if we want to protect
Americans from Ebola here

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:53.833
at home, we have to
end it over there.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:56.903
And as our civilian and military
personnel serve in the region,

00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:00.640
their safety and health
will remain a top priority.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.043
As I've said before, fighting
this disease will take time.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:06.746
Before this is over, we may
see more isolated cases

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.214
here in America.

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:10.216
But we know how to
wage this fight.

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:12.485
And if we take the steps
that are necessary,

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:15.622
if we're guided by the
science-the facts,

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:18.758
not fear-then I am absolutely
confident that we can prevent

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.160
a serious outbreak here
in the United States,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.797
and we can continue to lead the
world in this urgent effort.
