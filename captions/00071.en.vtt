00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.045
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.981
This weekend, I depart for Asia
to advance American leadership

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:17.617
and promote American jobs in
a dynamic region that will

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:21.221
be critical to our security and
prosperity in the century ahead.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:24.824
The democracies, progress and
growth we see across the Asia

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.427
Pacific would have been
impossible without America's

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:30.363
enduring commitment to
that region - especially

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:34.134
the service of generations
of Americans in uniform.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:37.737
As we approach Veterans' Day,
we honor them - and all those

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:41.007
who've served to keep
us free and strong.

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.476
We salute that Greatest
Generation who freed a continent

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.712
from fascism and fought
across Pacific Islands

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.714
to preserve our way of life.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.284
We pay tribute to Americans
who defended the people

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:53.453
of South Korea, soldiered
through the brutal battles

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:57.157
of Vietnam, stood up to
a tyrant in Desert Storm

00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:00.360
and stopped ethnic
cleansing in the Balkans.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.396
And we celebrate our newest
heroes from the 9/11 Generation

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:06.132
- our veterans from
Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:09.469
For more than 13 years, we have
been at war in Afghanistan.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.238
Next month, our combat
mission will be over,

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:16.009
and America's longest war will
come to a responsible end.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.077
But the end of a war
is just the beginning

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:21.281
of our obligations to those
who serve in our name.

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.817
These men and women will be
proud veterans for decades

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:27.020
to come, and our service to
them has only just begun.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.022
So as we welcome our
newest veterans home,

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:31.024
let's honor them by
giving them the thanks

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:32.292
and respect they deserve.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.427
And let's make sure we're there
for their families and children,

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:38.898
too - because they've also made
great sacrifices for America.

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:40.633
Let's honor our veterans
by making sure they

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:42.802
get the care and
benefits they've earned.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.437
That means health care
that's there for them

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:45.805
when they need it.

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:49.642
It means continuing to reduce
the disability claims backlog.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.111
And it means giving our wounded
warriors all the care and

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.148
support they need to heal,
including mental health care for

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:59.018
those with post-traumatic stress
or traumatic brain injury.

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:01.120
Some of the most moving moments
I've experienced as Commander

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.690
in Chief have been with
our wounded warriors.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.126
Some have to learn how to
walk again, talk again,

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.795
write their names again.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.664
But no matter how hard it
is, they never give up.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:12.899
They never quit.

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.735
And we can't ever
quit on them.

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.837
Let's honor our veterans by
making sure they get their shot

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:20.940
at the American Dream that they
risked their lives to defend -

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.310
by helping them find jobs worthy
of their skills and talents,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.714
and making sure the Post-9/11
GI Bill stays strong

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:30.783
so more veterans can earn
a college education.

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:33.419
When our veterans have the
opportunity to succeed,

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.687
our whole nation
is stronger.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:38.224
And let's work together to end
the tragedy of homelessness

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:41.294
among veterans once and for
all - because anyone who has

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:45.665
defended America deserves to
live in dignity in America.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.901
Finally, let's honor our
veterans by remembering

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:50.503
that this isn't just
a job for government.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.805
It's a job for
every American.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.941
We're all keepers of that
sacred trust that says,

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:58.678
if you put on a uniform and
risk your life to keep us safe,

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.813
we'll do our part for you.

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:03.383
We'll make sure you and your
family get the support you need.

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:06.686
We'l have your backs -
just like you had ours.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.688
So this Veterans'
Day, and every day,

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.690
let's make sure all our
veterans know how much

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.925
we appreciate them.

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:15.028
If you see a veteran, go
on up and shake their hand.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.362
Look them in the eye.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.364
Say those words that
every veteran deserves

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.900
to hear: "Welcome home.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.001
Thank you.

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.037
We need you more
than ever to help

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.639
us stay strong and free."

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.441
And then let's come
together as Americans

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:30.476
to make sure we're there
for them and their

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:33.613
families for all the
years of all their lives.

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:36.249
God Bless our Veterans
and their families

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.017
and God bless the United
States of America.
