00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.834
The President: Hi everybody.

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:14.633
This is commencement season, a
time for graduates and their

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:17.066
families to celebrate one of
the greatest achievements

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.166
of a young person's life.

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.433
But for many graduates, it
also means feeling trapped

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:25.433
by a whole lot of student loan
debt and we've got to do more

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:27.600
to lift that burden.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.967
See, in a 21st-century
economy, the surest pathway

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:34.900
into the middle class is some
form of higher education.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.266
The unemployment rate for
workers with a Bachelor's degree

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.867
is just 3.3 percent,

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:43.133
about half what it is for
high school graduates.

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.667
A typical graduate of a
four-year college earns $15,000

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:51.200
more per year than someone
with just a high school diploma.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.100
But at a time when college has
never been more important,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.633
it's also never
been more expensive.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:59.367
That's why since I took
office, I've worked to make

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:01.734
college more affordable.

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:04.367
We reformed the student loan
system that gave away billions

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:07.600
of taxpayer dollars to big
banks and invested that money

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.834
where it makes a bigger bang.

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:13.367
In helping more young people
afford a higher education.

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:16.133
But over the past three
decades, the average tuition

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:19.800
at a public four-year college
has more than tripled.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.266
The average undergraduate
student who borrows for college

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:26.900
now graduates almost $30,000 and
I've heard from too many young

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.066
people who are frustrated
that they've done everything

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:32.900
they were supposed to do and
now they're paying the price.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.767
I've taken action on my own
to offer millions of students

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:38.967
the opportunity to cap their
monthly student loan payments

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:41.433
to 10 percent of their income.

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:43.900
But Congress needs
to do its part.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.066
The good news is that Senate
Democrats are working

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:50.033
on a bill that would help
more young people save money.

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:52.433
Just like you can refinance your
mortgage at a lower interest

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:56.700
rate, this bill would let you
refinance your student loans.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.333
And we'd pay for it by closing
loopholes that allow some

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:03.633
millionaires to pay a lower tax
rate than the middle class.

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:06.300
That's the choice that your
representatives in Congress

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.166
will make in the coming weeks.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:11.066
Protect young people from
crushing debt or protect

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:12.400
tax breaks for millionaires.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.767
And while Congress decides
what it's going to do,

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:18.667
I will keep doing whatever
I can without Congress

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:22.066
to help responsible young
people pay off their loans,

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:25.100
including new action
I will take this week.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.700
This country has always made
a commitment to put a good

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.133
education within the reach
of all who are willing

00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:31.800
to work for it.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.800
That's what made us an
economic superpower.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.600
That's what makes us special and
as long as I hold this office,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.900
I'll keep fighting to give
more young people the chance

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.066
to earn their own piece
of the American Dream.

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:45.800
Thanks and have a great weekend.
