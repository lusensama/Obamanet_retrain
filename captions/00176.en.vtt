00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:08.800
The President:
This week, we mark the eleventh
anniversary of the September

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.934
11th attacks.

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:14.333
It's a time to remember the
nearly 3,000 innocent men,

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.100
women and children we lost,
and the families that they

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.066
left behind.

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.633
It's a chance to honor the
courage of the first responders

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:26.500
who risked their lives -- on
that day, and every day since.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.200
And it's an opportunity to give
thanks for our men and women in

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.500
uniform who have
served and sacrificed,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.200
sometimes far from home,
to keep our country safe.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.400
This anniversary is about them.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.033
It's also a time to reflect on
just how far we've come as a

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:44.867
nation these past eleven years.

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:48.233
On that clear September morning,
as America watched the towers

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:51.834
fall, and the Pentagon burn,
and the wreckage smoldering in a

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:55.967
Pennsylvania field, we
were filled with questions.

00:00:55.967 --> 00:00:59.934
Where had the attacks come from,
and how would America respond?

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:03.300
Would they fundamentally
weaken the country we love?

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.166
Would they change who we are?

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.967
The last decade has been a
difficult one, but together,

00:01:08.967 --> 00:01:12.200
we have answered those questions
and come back stronger as

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.500
a nation.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.266
We took the fight to al Qaeda,
decimating their leadership,

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:19.100
and put them on
the path to defeat.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.400
And thanks to the courage
and skill of our intelligence

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.367
personnel and armed forces,
Osama bin Laden will never

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:26.834
threaten America again.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:28.300
Instead of pulling
back from the world,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.100
we've strengthened our alliances
while improving our security

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.867
here at home.

00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:35.967
As Americans, we
refuse to live in fear.

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:39.333
Today, a new tower rises
above the New York skyline.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:42.900
And our country is stronger,
safer and more respected

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.867
in the world.

00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:46.333
Instead of turning
on each other,

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.767
we've resisted the temptation
to give in to mistrust

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:50.500
and suspicion.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.300
I've always said that America
is at war with al Qaeda and its

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.633
affiliates -- and we will never
be at war with Islam or any

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:58.367
other religion.

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:01.066
We are the United
States of America.

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:03.934
Our freedom and
diversity make us unique,

00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:07.900
and they will always be central
to who we are as a nation.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.767
Instead of changing who we are,
the attacks have brought out the

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:13.133
best in the American people.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:16.066
More than 5 million members of
the 9/11 Generation have worn

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:18.533
America's uniform
over the past decade,

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:21.667
and we've seen an outpouring of
goodwill towards our military,

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:24.533
our veterans and their families.

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:27.266
Together, they've done
everything we've asked of them.

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:30.734
We've ended the war in Iraq
and brought our troops home.

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:33.567
We brought an end to
the Taliban regime.

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:35.533
We've trained Afghan
Security Forces,

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:38.734
and forged a partnership
with a new Afghan Government.

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:41.867
And by the end 2014, the
transition in Afghanistan will

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:45.633
be complete and our
war there will be over.

00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:49.300
And finally, instead of
turning inward with grief,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.800
we've honored the memory of
those we lost by giving back to

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.033
our communities,
serving those in need,

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:58.166
and reaffirming the values
at the heart of who we are as

00:02:58.166 --> 00:02:59.667
a people.

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:02.433
That's why we mark September
11th as a National Day of

00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:04.867
Service and Remembrance.

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:07.300
Because we are one
American family.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.300
And we look out
for each other --

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.233
not just on the difficult
days, but every day.

00:03:13.233 --> 00:03:16.333
Eleven years later, that's
the legacy of 9/11 --

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:19.533
the ability to say with
confidence that no adversary and

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:23.400
no act of terrorism
can change who we are.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.500
We are Americans, and we will
protect and preserve this

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.533
country we love.

00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:32.767
On this solemn anniversary,
let's remember those we lost,

00:03:32.767 --> 00:03:35.433
let us reaffirm the
values they stood for,

00:03:35.433 --> 00:03:39.266
and let us keep moving forward
as one nation and one people.
