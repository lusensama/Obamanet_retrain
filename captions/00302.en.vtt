00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:08.000
I've often said that I don't believe government has the 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.100
answer to every problem, or that it can do all things for

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.000
all people. We're a nation built on 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.500
the strength of individual initiative.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.300
But there's certain things that we can't do on our own.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.400
There's certain things only government can do. 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.800
And one of those things is ensuring that the 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.000
foods we eat and the medicines we take are safe 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.000
and don't cause us harm. That's the mission 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.000
of our Food and Drug Administration and it is a mission 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.100
shared by our Department of Agriculture, and a variety 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.000
of other agencies and offices

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.300
at just about every level of government.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.500
The men and women who inspect our foods and test the safety

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.200
of our medicines are chemists and 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.100
physicians, veterinarians and pharmacists.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.500
It's because of the work they do each and every day that

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.300
the United States is one of the safest places in the world

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.000
to buy groceries at a supermarket or pills at a drugstore.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.300
Unlike citizens of so many other countries, Americans can trust

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.200
that there is a strong system in place to ensure that the 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.200
medications we give our children will help them get better,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.400
not make them sick; and that a family dinner 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.000
won't end in a trip to the doctor's office.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.800
But in recent years, we've seen a number of problems with

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.100
the food making its way to our kitchen tables.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.100
In 2006, it was contaminated spinach.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.300
In 2008, it was salmonella in peppers and possibly tomatoes.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.400
And just this year, bad peanut products led to hundreds

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.400
of illnesses and cost nine people their lives -- 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.200
a painful reminder of how tragic the consequences can be when

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.400
food producers act irresponsibly 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.400
and government is unable to do its job.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.900
Worse, these incidents reflect a troubling trend that's

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
seen the average number of outbreaks from contaminated produce 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.200
and other foods grow to nearly 350 a year --

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.800
up from 100 a year in the early 1990s.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.000
Part of the reason is that many of the laws and regulations 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.300
governing food safety in America have not been updated since

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.000
they were written in the time of Teddy Roosevelt.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.000
It's also because our system of inspection and enforcement 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.200
is spread out so widely among so many people that it's difficult

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.100
for different parts of our government

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.200
to share information, work together, and solve problems.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.700
And it's also because the FDA has been underfunded and understaffed

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.200
in recent years, leaving the agency with the resources to inspect

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.800
just 7,000 of our 150,000 food processing plants and warehouses

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.300
each year. That means roughly 95 percent of them go uninspected.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.200
That's a hazard to public health. It's unacceptable.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.000
And it will change under the leadership of Dr. Margaret Hamburg,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.900
whom I'm appointing today as Commissioner

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
of the Food and Drug Administration.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.100
From her research on infectious disease at the National Institutes

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.000
of Health to her work on public health at the Department of Health

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.000
and Human Services, to her leadership on biodefense at the Nuclear

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.000
Threat Initiative, Dr. Hamburg brings to this vital position

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.000
not only a reputation of integrity but a record of achievement

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.000
in making Americans safer and more secure. Dr. Hamburg was one of

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.100
the youngest people ever elected to the National Academy of Sciences'

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.000
Institute of Medicine. And her two children have a unique distinction

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.000
of their own. Their birth certificates feature her name twice -- 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.300
once as their mother, and once as New York City Health Commissioner. 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
In that role, Dr. Hamburg brought a new life to a demoralized agency,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.800
leading an internationally-recognized initiative that cut the 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.000
tuberculosis rate by nearly half, and overseeing

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.400
food safety in our nation's largest city.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.200
Joining her as Principal Deputy Commissioner will be Dr. Joshua Sharfstein.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.000
As Baltimore's Health Commissioner, Dr. Sharfstein has been recognized

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.300
as a national leader for his efforts to protect children from unsafe

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.100
over-the-counter cough and cold medications. 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.000
And he's designed an award-winning program to ensure that Americans

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.400
with disabilities had access to prescription drugs.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Their critical work -- and the critical work of the FDA they lead -- 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.000
will be part of a larger effort taken up by a new Food Safety 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.000
Working Group I'm creating. This working group will bring together 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.000
Cabinet secretaries and senior officials to advise me on how we can 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.200
upgrade our food safety laws for the 21st century; foster coordination 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.300
throughout our government; and ensure that we are not just designing 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.200
laws that will keep the American people safe, but enforcing them.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.400
And I expect this group to report back to me 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.500
with recommendations as soon as possible.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
As part of our commitment to public health, our Agriculture Department

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.100
is closing a loophole in the system to ensure that diseased cows don't

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.500
find their way into the food supply. And we're also strengthening our

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.300
food safety system and modernizing our labs with a $1 billion investment,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.300
a portion of which will go toward significantly increasing the number 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.400
of food inspectors, helping ensure that the FDA has the staff and support

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.000
they need to protect the food we eat.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.800
In the end, food safety is something I take seriously, not just as your

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.100
President, but as a parent. When I heard peanut products were being

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.000
contaminated earlier this year, I immediately thought of my 7-year old 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.000
daughter, Sasha, who has peanut butter sandwiches for lunch probably 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.200
three times a week. No parent should have to worry that their child

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.000
is going to get sick from their lunch. Just as no family should have to 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.000
worry that the medicines they buy will cause them harm.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.600
Protecting the safety of our food and drugs is one of the most fundamental

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.400
responsibilities government has, and, with the outstanding team

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.000
I'm announcing today, it is a responsibility that I intend

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.400
to uphold in the months and years to come.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.500
Thanks.
