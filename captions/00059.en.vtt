00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.511
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.746
In my State of
the Union Address,

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.948
I laid out my ideas to
help working families

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:17.617
feel more secure and earn
the skills required

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:20.754
to advance in a world
of constant change.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.756
And in a new economy
that's increasingly

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:25.892
built on knowledge and
innovation, a core element

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:28.294
of this middle-class
economics is how well

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:32.165
we prepare our kids
for the future.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.701
For decades, we threw money
at education without

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:37.837
making sure our schools
were actually improving,

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.673
or whether we were giving
teachers the tools they need,

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:43.576
or whether our taxpayer dollars
were being used effectively.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:47.981
And our kids too
often paid the price.

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:50.383
Now, over the past few years,
we've seen signs that our

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:54.654
elementary and secondary school
students are doing better.

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.156
Last year, our younger
students earned

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:59.325
the highest math and
reading scores on record.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.895
Last week, we learned
that our high school

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:05.565
graduation rate hit a
new all-time high.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.367
This is progress.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:11.271
But in a 21st century economy,
our kids will only do better

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:15.108
than we did if we educate them
better than we were educated.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:17.544
So we have to do more to
make sure they graduate

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:21.881
from school fully prepared
for college and a career.

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:24.884
This year, I want to work
with both parties in Congress

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.320
to replace No Child Left
Behind with a smarter law

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.357
that addresses the overuse
of standardized tests,

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.560
makes a real investment
in preschool,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.398
and gives every kid a fair
shot in the new economy.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.400
Now, it's pretty
commonsense that

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.602
an education bill should
actually improve education.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.638
But as we speak, there's
a Republican bill

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:49.476
in Congress that would
frankly do the opposite.

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:52.078
At a time when we should
invest more in our kids,

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.547
their plan would lock
in cuts to schools for

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:56.249
the rest of this decade.

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.685
We'd end up actually
invest less in our

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:03.857
kids in 2021 than we
did in 2012.

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:06.459
At a time when we should give
our teachers all the resources

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.662
they need, their plan could
let states and cities

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:12.365
shuffle education dollars
into things like sports

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:16.102
stadiums or tax cuts
for the wealthy.

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:19.072
At a time when we have to
give every child, everywhere,

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:22.475
a fair shot - this Congress
would actually allow states

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.144
to make even deeper cuts
into school districts that

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:28.248
need the most support,
send even more money

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:31.217
to some of the wealthiest
school districts in America,

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:33.720
and turn back the clock
to a time when too many

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.924
students were left behind
in failing schools.

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:40.360
Denying a quality education
to the children of working

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.029
families is as wrong
as denying health care

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:45.999
or child care to
working families.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.066
We are better than this.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.604
I have a different vision
for the middle class.

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:54.641
In today's world, we have
to equip all our kids

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.643
with an education that
prepares them for

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:58.645
success, regardless of
what they look like,

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:01.514
or how much their parents
make, or the zip code

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:02.515
they live in.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.951
And that means
trying new things,

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:08.922
investing in what's working,
and fixing what's not.

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:11.157
That means cutting testing
down to the bare minimum

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:13.660
required to make sure
parents and teachers know

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.795
how our kids and schools
are doing from year

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:19.632
to year, and relative
to schools statewide.

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.634
That means giving the
teachers and principals

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:24.704
who do the hard work every
day the resources they need

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.941
to spend less time teaching
to a test, and more time

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.943
teaching our kids the
skills they need.

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.314
Some of these
changes are hard.

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:37.617
They'll require all of us to
demand more of our schools

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:41.020
and more of our kids,
making sure they put down

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.424
the video games and iPhones,
and pick up the books.

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:47.026
They'll require us to demand
that Washington treat

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:51.264
education reform as the
dedicated progress of decades -

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.533
something a town with
a short attention

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.535
span doesn't always
do very well.

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.637
But I'm confident
we can do this.

00:03:57.637 --> 00:04:01.140
When it comes to education,
we are not a collection

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.943
of states competing
against one another;

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:07.413
we're a nation competing
against the world.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.816
Nothing will determine
our success as a nation

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:12.952
in the 21st century more than
how well we educate our kids.

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:16.889
And we shouldn't accept
anything less than the best.

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:21.594
So, thanks everybody,
and before I go -

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.830
Happy Valentine's
Day, Michelle.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.598
Have a great
weekend, everybody.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:26.666
Bye-bye.
