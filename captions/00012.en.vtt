00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.379
The President: Hi everybody.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.781
One of the things that makes
America great is our passion

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.517
for innovation - that
spirit of discovery and

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:19.986
entrepreneurship that helps
us meet any challenge.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.856
One of the greatest
challenges of our time is

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.391
climate change.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.393
Over the last seven years,
we've made historic

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.661
investments in clean energy
that helped private sector

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.998
companies create tens of
thousands of good jobs.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:34.567
And today, clean power from
the wind or the sun is

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:37.170
actually cheaper in many
communities than dirtier,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.139
conventional power.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.574
It's helped grow our economy
and cut our total carbon

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:45.779
pollution more than any
other country on earth.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:49.015
That leadership helped bring
nearly 200 nations together

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:51.451
in Paris around the most
ambitious climate agreement

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.919
in history.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.121
And in Paris, we also
launched one of the most

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.857
important partnerships ever
assembled to accelerate this

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:00.827
kind of clean energy
innovation around the world.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.229
Investors and business
leaders including Bill

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.733
Gates, Meg Whitman, and
Mark Zuckerberg joined us,

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.269
pledging their own money
to help advance new

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:12.205
technologies to the market.

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:14.274
That's important because
we'll only meet this

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:17.043
challenge if the private
sector helps lead the way.

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:20.013
As I said in my State
of the Union address,

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.115
rather than
subsidize the past,

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:24.083
we should invest
in the future.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:26.219
That's why the budget I
will send to Congress this

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.788
Tuesday will double funding
for clean energy research

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:31.658
and development by 2020.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:33.760
This will include new
investments to help the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.229
private sector create
more jobs faster,

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.865
lower the cost of
clean energy faster,

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:42.669
and help clean, renewable
power outcompete dirty fuels

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.737
in every state.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.739
And while Republicans
in Congress are still

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:48.908
considering their position
on climate change,

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:51.444
many of them realize
that clean energy is an

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.446
incredible source of
good-paying jobs

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:55.415
for their constituents.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.684
That's why we were able to
boost clean energy research

00:01:57.684 --> 00:02:00.019
and development in last
year's budget agreement.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:02.355
And I hope they support my
plan to double that kind

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.923
of investment.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:07.193
Because it's making a
difference across the country.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:10.163
In Idaho, our Battery Test
Center is helping electric

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.932
cars run longer on
a single charge.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.535
In Ohio, entrepreneurs are
pioneering new ways to

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:18.304
harness wind power
from the Great Lakes.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.440
In Tennessee, researchers
are partnering with

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.943
utilities to boost storage
and solar power to create a

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:26.679
more resilient
electric grid.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.681
The point is, all
across the country,

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.917
folks are putting their
differences aside to face

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.586
this challenge as one.

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.555
Washington should
do the same.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:37.790
That's how we're going to
solve this challenge - together.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.792
And that's how we're going
to give our kids and

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:43.229
grandkids the future they
deserve - one with a safe,

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.299
secure, and
prosperous planet.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.402
Thanks everybody, and
have a great weekend.
