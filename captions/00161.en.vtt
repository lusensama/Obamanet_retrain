00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:07.300
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.400
Over the past year, as I
traveled across the country

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.433
campaigning for this office, I
told you that if I was fortunate

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:15.700
enough to be re-elected, I'd
work to change a tax code that

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.166
too often benefited the
wealthy at the expense of the

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.800
middle class.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.734
This week, we did that.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:23.500
For the first time
in two decades,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.567
we raised taxes on the
wealthiest 2% of Americans in a

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:30.467
bipartisan way, while preventing
a middle-class tax hike that

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:33.567
could have thrown our
economy back into recession.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:37.967
Under this law, more than 98%
of Americans and 97% of small

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:42.333
business will not see their
income taxes go up one dime.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.734
We also made sure that millions
of families will continue to

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:47.867
receive tax credits to help
raise their children and send

00:00:47.867 --> 00:00:49.500
them to college.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.600
Companies will continue to
receive tax credits for the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.533
research they do, the
investments that they make,

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.433
and the clean energy
jobs that they create.

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:00.066
And two million Americans who
are out of work will continue to

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:03.200
receive unemployment benefits
so long as they are actively

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.333
looking for a job.

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:08.033
But all this was just one step
in the broader effort to grow

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:10.300
our economy and
shrink our deficits.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.200
We still need to do more to put
Americans back to work while

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.800
also putting this country on
a path to pay down its debt.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.600
And our economy can't afford
more protracted showdowns or

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.166
manufactured crises
along the way.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:26.567
Because even as our businesses
created 2 million new jobs last

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:30.533
year -- including 168,000
new jobs last month --

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:33.567
the messy brinksmanship in
Congress made business owners

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:37.567
more uncertain and
consumers less confident.

00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:39.667
We know there's a path forward.

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:42.667
Last year, I signed into
law $1.7 trillion in

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:44.467
deficit reduction.

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:48.467
This week's action further
reduces the deficit by $737

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:52.033
billion, making it one of the
largest deficit reduction bills

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:54.633
passed by Congress
in over a decade.

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:56.633
And I'm willing to do more.

00:01:56.633 --> 00:02:00.133
I believe we can find more
places to cut spending without

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:03.166
shortchanging things like
education, job training,

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:06.433
research and technology all
of which are critical to our

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:09.667
prosperity in a 21st
century economy.

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:13.033
But spending cuts must be
balanced with more reforms to

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:14.800
our tax code.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.500
The wealthiest individuals
and the biggest corporations

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.567
shouldn't be able to take
advantage of loopholes and

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:23.467
deductions that aren't
available to most Americans.

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:26.333
As I said earlier this week, one
thing I will not compromise over

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:29.166
is whether or not Congress
should pay the tab for a bill

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:30.834
they've already racked up.

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:33.433
If Congress refuses to give the
United States the ability to pay

00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:35.934
its bills on time, the
consequences for the entire

00:02:35.934 --> 00:02:38.700
global economy could
be catastrophic.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.433
The last time Congress
threatened this course of

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:43.467
action, our entire
economy suffered for it.

00:02:43.467 --> 00:02:46.166
Our families and our businesses
cannot afford that dangerous

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.200
game again.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.700
I congratulate the newly
sworn-in Members of Congress,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.000
and I look forward to working
with the new Congress in a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.033
bipartisan way.

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:57.633
If we focus on the interests of
our country above the interests

00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:01.233
of party, I'm convinced we can
cut spending and raise revenue

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:03.600
in a manner that reduces our
deficit and protects the

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.000
middle class.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.233
And we can step up to meet the
important business that awaits

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:09.533
us this year.

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:12.767
Creating jobs; boosting incomes;
fixing our infrastructure and

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:14.500
our immigration system.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.767
Promoting our energy
independence while protecting

00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:19.900
our planet from the harmful
effects of climate change.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.367
Educating our children and
shielding them from the horrors

00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:25.266
of gun violence.

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:26.667
These aren't just
things we should do --

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:28.033
they're things we must do.

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:30.967
And in this New Year, I'll
fight as hard as I know how to

00:03:30.967 --> 00:03:32.400
get them done.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.467
Happy New Year, everybody.
