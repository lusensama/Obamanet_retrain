00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.567
The President:
I'm here in Detroit visiting
workers at a GM plant in the

00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:11.400
heart of a resurgent
American auto industry.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.233
And I brought a guest with me
-- President Lee of South Korea.

00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:18.166
We're here because this week,
Congress passed landmark trade

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.867
agreements with
countries like Korea,

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:23.600
and assistance for American
workers that will be a big win

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.367
for our economy.

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:27.967
These trade agreements will
support tens of thousands of

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:29.533
American jobs.

00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:32.633
And we'll sell more Fords,
Chevys and Chryslers abroad

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:36.667
stamped with three proud
words -- "Made in America."

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:40.033
So it was good to see Congress
act in a bipartisan way on

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:43.000
something that will help create
jobs at a time when millions of

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.700
Americans are still out
of work and need them now.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.433
But that's also why it was so
disappointing to see Senate

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:53.200
Republicans obstruct
the American Jobs Act,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.166
even though a majority of
Senators voted "yes" to advance

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.166
this jobs bill.

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.700
We can't afford
this lack of action.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.500
And there's no reason for it.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.033
Independent economists say that
this jobs bill would give the

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:11.333
economy a jumpstart and lead to
nearly two million new jobs.

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.533
Every idea in the jobs bill is
the kind of idea both parties

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.867
have supported in the past.

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:20.000
The majority of the American
people support the proposals in

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.600
this jobs bill.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.200
And they want action from their
elected leaders to create jobs

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.367
and restore some security for
the middle class right now.

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:33.800
You deserve to see your hard
work and responsibility rewarded

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.200
-- and you certainly deserve
to see it reflected in the folks

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.333
you send to Washington.

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.533
But rather than listen to you
and put folks back to work,

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:44.333
Republicans in the House spent
the past couple of days picking

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.867
partisan ideological fights.

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:48.633
They're seeing if they can
roll back clean air and

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:50.233
water protections.

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:52.467
They're stirring up fights over
a woman's right to make her own

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:54.467
health care choices.

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:57.667
They're not focused on the
concrete actions that will put

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:00.233
people back to work right now.

00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:02.700
Well, we're going to
give them another chance.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.100
We're going to give them another
chance to spend more time

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.600
worrying about your jobs
than keeping theirs.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.734
Next week, I'm urging Members
of Congress to vote on putting

00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:14.767
hundreds of thousands of
teachers back in the classroom,

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:18.967
cops back on the streets, and
firefighters back on the job.

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:22.467
And if they vote "no" on that,
they'll have to tell you why.

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:25.166
They'll have to tell you why
teachers in your community don't

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:27.300
deserve a paycheck again.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.967
They'll have to tell your kids
why they don't deserve to have

00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:31.700
their teacher back.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.000
They'll have to tell you why
they're against commonsense

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.967
proposals that would help
families and strengthen our

00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:40.467
communities right now
and in the long term.

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:42.967
In the coming weeks, we'll have
them vote on the other parts of

00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:45.567
the jobs bill -- putting
construction workers back on the

00:02:45.567 --> 00:02:48.100
job rebuilding our
roads and bridges;

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.500
providing tax cuts for small
businesses that hire our

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.734
veterans; making sure that
middle-class families don't see

00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:56.834
a tax hike next year and
that the unemployed and our

00:02:56.834 --> 00:03:00.300
out-of-work youth have a chance
to get back in the workforce and

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.633
earn their piece of
the American Dream.

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:04.200
That's what's at stake.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.000
Putting people back to work.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.867
Restoring economic security
for the middle class.

00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:11.300
Rebuilding an economy where
hard work is valued and

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.033
responsibility is rewarded --
an economy that's built to last.

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:18.367
And I'm going to travel all over
the country over the next few

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:22.100
weeks so that we can remind
Congress that that's the most

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.834
important thing.

00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:25.867
Because there's still time
to create jobs and grow our

00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:27.934
economy right now.

00:03:27.934 --> 00:03:31.333
There's still time for Congress
to do the right thing.

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.000
We just need to act.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.066
Thanks.
