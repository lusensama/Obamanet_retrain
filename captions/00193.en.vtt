00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:12.328
The President:
On Friday, I traveled to Ft.
Stewart in Georgia to meet with

00:00:12.328 --> 00:00:15.428
soldiers from the Third
Infantry Division.

00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:17.961
These men and women have fought
with bravery and honor in some

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:20.695
of the most dangerous
places on the planet.

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:22.795
Some of them didn't
make it back.

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:25.061
But those who did are now
fighting a different kind of

00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:26.861
battle here at home.

00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:29.361
They're looking for new
jobs, new opportunities,

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:31.594
and new ways to serve.

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:33.528
For many, that means
going back to school --

00:00:33.528 --> 00:00:36.594
and America has a long tradition
of making sure our veterans and

00:00:36.594 --> 00:00:40.127
our men and women in uniform
can afford to do that.

00:00:40.127 --> 00:00:42.994
After World War II, we helped
a generation of Americans --

00:00:42.994 --> 00:00:47.227
including my grandfather -- to
go to school on the GI Bill.

00:00:47.227 --> 00:00:50.661
Now, thanks to the 9/11 GI
Bill and the Tuition Assistance

00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:53.795
program, last year we supported
more than half a million

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:57.461
veterans and over 300,000
service members who are pursuing

00:00:57.461 --> 00:00:59.828
a higher education degree.

00:00:59.828 --> 00:01:01.361
That's progress.

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:04.761
But it's not enough to just help
our veterans and service members

00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:08.027
afford school -- we need to make
sure they have all the tools

00:01:08.027 --> 00:01:10.628
they need to make an informed
decision when it comes to

00:01:10.628 --> 00:01:12.761
picking the right program.

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:15.328
The sad truth is that there are
people out there who are less

00:01:15.328 --> 00:01:17.461
interested in helping our men
and women in uniform getting

00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:21.027
ahead and more interested
in making a buck.

00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:23.961
They bombard potential students
with emails and pressure them

00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:25.895
into making a quick decision.

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:28.961
Some of them steer recruits
towards high-interest loans and

00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:31.027
mislead them about
credit transfers and job

00:01:31.027 --> 00:01:32.761
placement programs.

00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:35.761
One of the worst examples was a
college recruiter who visited a

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.828
Marine barracks and enrolled
Marines with brain injuries so

00:01:38.828 --> 00:01:41.795
severe that some of them
couldn't recall what courses the

00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:43.895
recruiter had
signed them up for.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:45.328
That's appalling.

00:01:45.328 --> 00:01:46.828
It's disgraceful.

00:01:46.828 --> 00:01:49.027
And even though the vast
majority of schools do the right

00:01:49.027 --> 00:01:52.895
thing, we need to guard against
the bad actors who don't.

00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:56.027
That's why, on Friday, I signed
an Executive Order making life a

00:01:56.027 --> 00:01:58.394
whole lot more secure
for our service members,

00:01:58.394 --> 00:02:01.194
veterans and their families
-- and a whole lot tougher for

00:02:01.194 --> 00:02:03.394
anyone who tries
to prey on them.

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:06.061
We're making sure veterans and
service members get a simple

00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:09.895
fact sheet called "Know Before
You Owe" that lays out all the

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:12.428
information they need about
financial aid and paying

00:02:12.428 --> 00:02:13.761
for college.

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.861
We're requiring schools to offer
counseling to help students

00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:20.561
finish their degree even if
they have to move or deploy.

00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:22.628
And we're stepping up our
efforts to fight dishonest

00:02:22.628 --> 00:02:26.261
recruiters by strengthening the
rules about who can come on base

00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:29.761
and make it easier
to file complaints.

00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:31.861
When our men and women
in uniform succeed,

00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:34.027
our country succeeds.

00:02:34.027 --> 00:02:37.728
They have our backs -- now
it's our turn to have theirs.

00:02:37.728 --> 00:02:39.994
And as long as I'm President,
I'm going to make sure that

00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:43.127
anyone who serves this
country gets every opportunity

00:02:43.127 --> 00:02:44.628
they deserve.

00:02:44.628 --> 00:02:46.294
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
