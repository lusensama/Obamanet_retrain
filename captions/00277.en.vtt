00:00:05.692 --> 00:00:09.892
The President:
45 years ago, we made a solemn compact as a nation that senior

00:00:09.892 --> 00:00:13.291
citizens would not go without
the health care they need.

00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:16.591
This is the promise we made
when Medicare was born.

00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:20.391
And it's the responsibility of
each generation to keep that promise.

00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:24.058
That's why a report issued this
week by the Trustees who oversee

00:00:24.058 --> 00:00:26.358
Medicare was such good news.

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:29.858
According to this report, the
steps we took this year to

00:00:29.858 --> 00:00:34.024
reform the health care system
have put Medicare on a sounder

00:00:34.024 --> 00:00:35.958
financial footing.

00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.725
Reform has actually added at
least a dozen years to the

00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:42.391
solvency of Medicare -- the single longest extension in

00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:45.325
history -- while helping
to preserve Medicare for

00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:47.658
generations to come.

00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:51.124
We've made Medicare more solvent
by going after waste, fraud,

00:00:51.124 --> 00:00:56.158
and abuse -- not by changing seniors' guaranteed benefits.

00:00:56.158 --> 00:00:58.958
In fact, seniors are starting
to see that because of health

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:03.458
reform, their benefits are
getting better all the time.

00:01:03.458 --> 00:01:05.658
Seniors who fall into
the "doughnut hole" --

00:01:05.658 --> 00:01:07.892
the gap in Medicare
Part D drug coverage --

00:01:07.892 --> 00:01:12.458
are eligible right now for a
$250 rebate to help cover the

00:01:12.458 --> 00:01:14.191
cost of their prescriptions.

00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:17.024
Now, I know for people facing
drug costs far higher than that,

00:01:17.024 --> 00:01:18.358
they need more help.

00:01:18.358 --> 00:01:21.458
So starting next year, if you
fall in the doughnut hole,

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:25.825
you'll get a 50% discount on the
brand-name medicine you need.

00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:29.291
And in the coming years, this
law will close the doughnut hole

00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:31.825
completely once and for all.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.792
Already, we've put insurance
companies on notice that we have

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:37.725
the authority to review and
reject unreasonable rate

00:01:37.725 --> 00:01:40.958
increases for Medicare
Advantage plans.

00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.725
And we've made it clear to the
insurers that we won't hesitate

00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:46.991
to use this authority
to protect seniors.

00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:49.024
Beginning next year,
preventive care --

00:01:49.024 --> 00:01:51.725
including annual
physicals, wellness exams,

00:01:51.725 --> 00:01:55.892
and tests like mammograms -- will be free for seniors as well.

00:01:55.892 --> 00:01:58.224
That'll make it easier
for folks to stay healthy.

00:01:58.224 --> 00:02:00.458
But it will also mean that
doctors can catch things

00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:05.525
earlier, so treatment may
be less invasive and less expensive.

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.425
And as reform ramps up
in the coming years,

00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:12.191
we expect seniors to save an
average of $200 per year in

00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:16.625
premiums and more than $200 each
year in out of pocket costs, too.

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:19.024
This is possible in part through
reforms that target waste and

00:02:19.024 --> 00:02:21.925
abuse and redirect those
resources to where they're

00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:24.124
supposed to go: our seniors.

00:02:24.124 --> 00:02:27.358
We're already on track to cut
improper payments in half --

00:02:27.358 --> 00:02:29.792
including money that goes to
criminals who steal taxpayer

00:02:29.792 --> 00:02:33.191
dollars by setting up insurance
scams and other frauds.

00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:35.024
And we won't stop there.

00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:38.058
Because by preventing the
loss of these tax dollars,

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:41.792
we can both address the runaway
costs of Medicare and improve

00:02:41.792 --> 00:02:43.858
the quality of care
seniors receive --

00:02:43.858 --> 00:02:46.991
and we can crack down on those
who prey on seniors and take

00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:48.825
advantage of people.

00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:51.658
So we are no longer
accepting business as usual.

00:02:51.658 --> 00:02:55.491
We're making tough decisions to
meet the challenges of our time.

00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:59.625
And as a result, Medicare is
stronger and more secure.

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:01.058
That's important.

00:03:01.058 --> 00:03:03.258
Because Medicare
isn't just a program.

00:03:03.258 --> 00:03:05.591
It's a commitment to
America's seniors --

00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:07.658
that after working
your whole life,

00:03:07.658 --> 00:03:11.591
you've earned the security of
quality health care you can afford.

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.258
As long as I am President,
that's a commitment this country

00:03:14.258 --> 00:03:16.591
is going to keep.

00:03:16.591 --> 00:03:17.725
Thanks.
