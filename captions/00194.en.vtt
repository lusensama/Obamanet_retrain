00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:09.561
The President:
Hi.

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:12.094
This week, I got the chance to
sit down with some impressive

00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:15.928
students at Lorain County
Community College in Ohio.

00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:18.661
One of them was a woman
named Andrea Ashley.

00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:21.761
Two years ago, Andrea lost
her job as an HR analyst.

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:24.628
And today, she's getting
certified in the fast-growing

00:00:24.628 --> 00:00:27.661
field of electronic
medical records.

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:31.127
Before enrolling at Lorain,
Andrea told me she was looking

00:00:31.127 --> 00:00:33.828
everywhere trying
to find a new job.

00:00:33.828 --> 00:00:37.294
But without a degree, she said
that nobody would hire her.

00:00:37.294 --> 00:00:39.561
Andrea's story isn't unique.

00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:41.928
I've met so many Americans
who are out there pounding the

00:00:41.928 --> 00:00:44.928
pavement looking for work
only to discover that they

00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:46.361
need new skills.

00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:49.027
And I've met a lot of employers
who are looking for workers,

00:00:49.027 --> 00:00:52.428
but can't find ones with the
skills they're looking for.

00:00:52.428 --> 00:00:55.528
So we should be doing everything
we can to put higher education

00:00:55.528 --> 00:00:57.828
within reach for
every American --

00:00:57.828 --> 00:01:00.127
because at a time when the
unemployment rate for Americans

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:02.628
with at least a college degree
is about half the national

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:05.661
average, it's never
been more important.

00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:09.294
But here's the thing: it's
also never been more expensive.

00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:12.061
Students who take out loans to
pay for college graduate owing

00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:14.728
an average of $25,000.

00:01:14.728 --> 00:01:17.761
For the first time, Americans
owe more debt on their student

00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:20.227
loans than they do on
their credit cards.

00:01:20.227 --> 00:01:23.061
And for many working families,
the idea of owing that much

00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:25.795
money means that higher
education is simply out of reach

00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:27.961
for their children.

00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:31.127
Now in America, higher
education cannot be a luxury.

00:01:31.127 --> 00:01:34.227
It's an economic imperative
that every family must be able

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:35.695
to afford.

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:37.928
That's why next week I'll be
visiting colleges across the

00:01:37.928 --> 00:01:40.961
country, talking to students
about how we can make higher

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:44.127
education more affordable --
and what's at stake right now if

00:01:44.127 --> 00:01:47.061
Congress doesn't do
something about it.

00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:48.728
You see, if Congress
doesn't act,

00:01:48.728 --> 00:01:53.061
on July 1st interest rates on
some student loans will double.

00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:56.628
Nearly seven and half million
students will end up owing more

00:01:56.628 --> 00:01:58.294
on their loan payments.

00:01:58.294 --> 00:01:59.728
That would be a tremendous blow.

00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:02.061
And it's completely preventable.

00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:04.328
This issue didn't
come out of nowhere.

00:02:04.328 --> 00:02:06.494
For some time now, I've been
calling on Congress to take

00:02:06.494 --> 00:02:09.261
steps to make higher
education more affordable --

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:11.628
to prevent these interest
rates from doubling,

00:02:11.628 --> 00:02:14.428
to extend the tuition tax credit
that has saved middle-class

00:02:14.428 --> 00:02:17.695
families millions of dollars,
and to double the number of

00:02:17.695 --> 00:02:20.895
work-study jobs over
the next five years.

00:02:20.895 --> 00:02:23.161
Instead, over the
past few years,

00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:26.161
Republicans in Congress have
voted against new ways to make

00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:28.994
college more affordable
for middle-class families,

00:02:28.994 --> 00:02:31.828
while voting for huge new tax
cuts for millionaires and

00:02:31.828 --> 00:02:35.261
billionaires -- tax cuts that
would have to be paid for by

00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:37.828
cutting things like education
and job-training programs that

00:02:37.828 --> 00:02:41.795
give students new opportunities
to work and succeed.

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:44.695
We cannot just cut
our way to prosperity.

00:02:44.695 --> 00:02:47.361
Making it harder for our
young people to afford higher

00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:50.795
education and earn their degrees
is nothing more than cutting our

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:53.027
own future off at the knees.

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:55.828
Congress needs to keep interest
rates on student loans from

00:02:55.828 --> 00:02:58.394
doubling, and they
need to do it now.

00:02:58.394 --> 00:03:00.227
This is a question of values.

00:03:00.227 --> 00:03:03.127
We cannot let America become a
country where a shrinking number

00:03:03.127 --> 00:03:05.928
of people do really well, while
a growing number of people

00:03:05.928 --> 00:03:07.728
struggle to get by.

00:03:07.728 --> 00:03:10.828
We've got to build an economy
where everyone gets a fair shot,

00:03:10.828 --> 00:03:14.027
everyone does their fair share,
and everyone plays by the same

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.561
set of rules.

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:17.961
That's how the middle
class gets stronger.

00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:20.528
That's an economy
that's built to last.

00:03:20.528 --> 00:03:22.994
And I'm not only going to take
that case to college campuses

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:25.227
next week -- I'm going to
take it to every part of the

00:03:25.227 --> 00:03:27.394
country this year.

00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:29.127
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
