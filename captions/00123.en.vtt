The President:
Good morning.

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:12.895
Over the past few days, I've met
with Republicans and Democrats

00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:15.728
from both houses of Congress in
an effort to reopen

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:18.394
your government and remove the
dangers of default

00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:19.895
from our economy.

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:23.027
It's a positive development that
House Republicans have agreed

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:25.728
on the need to avoid the
economic consequences of not

00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:28.127
meeting our country's
commitments because

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:30.695
once the debt ceiling is raised
and the shutdown is over,

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:33.061
there's a lot we can accomplish
together.

00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:35.561
We've created seven-and-a-half
million new jobs

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:37.461
in the past three-and-a-half
years.

00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:39.328
Now let's create more.

00:00:39.328 --> 00:00:42.261
We've cut our deficits in half
over the past four years,

00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:45.861
now let's do it in a smarter,
balanced way that lets us

00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:49.027
afford to invest in the things
we need to grow.

00:00:49.027 --> 00:00:52.194
The truth is, there's a lot we
can agree on, but one thing

00:00:52.194 --> 00:00:55.227
we have to agree on is that
there's no good reason

00:00:55.227 --> 00:00:59.161
anyone should keep suffering
through this shutdown.

00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:01.261
I met with some really
innovative small business owners

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:05.127
on Friday who've already lost
contracts, lost customers,

00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:08.661
and put hiring on hold because
the pain of this Repbulican

00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:12.294
shutdown has trickled down to
their bottom lines.

00:01:12.294 --> 00:01:14.628
It's hurting the very citizens
that our government

00:01:14.628 --> 00:01:16.294
exists to serve.

00:01:16.294 --> 00:01:19.161
That's why a growing number of
reasonable Republicans say

00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:21.861
it should end now.

00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:24.428
And it wouldn't be wise, as some
suggest, to just kick

00:01:24.428 --> 00:01:27.361
the debt ceiling can down the
road for a couple of months,

00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:30.194
and flirt with the first ever
intentional default right

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:33.928
in the middle of the holiday
shopping season because damage

00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:36.394
to America's sterling credit
rating wouldn't just cause

00:01:36.394 --> 00:01:39.928
global markets to go haywire, it
would become more expensive

00:01:39.928 --> 00:01:43.528
for everyone in America to
borrow money.

00:01:43.528 --> 00:01:47.461
Students paying for college,
newlyweds buying a home,

00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:51.328
it would amount to a new tax, a
Republican default tax,

00:01:51.328 --> 00:01:54.594
on every family and business in
America.

00:01:54.594 --> 00:01:57.428
It doesn't have to be this way,
it's not supposed

00:01:57.428 --> 00:01:59.294
to be this way.

00:01:59.294 --> 00:02:02.494
Manufacturing crises to extract
massive concessions isn't

00:02:02.494 --> 00:02:05.394
how our democracy works and we
have to stop it.

00:02:05.394 --> 00:02:08.994
Politics is a battle of ideas,
but you advance those ideas

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:12.961
through elections and
legislation, not extortion.

00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:15.061
I know you're frustrated by what
you see in your nation's

00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:18.761
capital right now, but because
it's easy to get lost in,

00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:21.027
or give up on the political back
and forth, I want you

00:02:21.027 --> 00:02:23.261
to remember this is not normal.

00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:27.461
Our government is closed for the
first time in 17 years.

00:02:27.461 --> 00:02:29.528
A political party is risking
default for the first time

00:02:29.528 --> 00:02:32.494
since the 1700s.

00:02:32.494 --> 00:02:35.328
This is not normal, and that's
why we have to put a stop to it,

00:02:35.328 --> 00:02:38.161
not only because it's dangerous,
but because it saps everyone's

00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:41.994
faith in our extraordinary
system of self government,

00:02:41.994 --> 00:02:44.094
and that hurts us all.

00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:46.027
Whether it's the work of
creating jobs,

00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:48.261
growing the economy, or getting
our fiscal house in order

00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:51.428
for the long haul, we've got a
lot of work to do,

00:02:51.428 --> 00:02:54.628
and constant brinksmanship
doesn't let us do it.

00:02:54.628 --> 00:02:57.261
It inflicts real pain on real
people.

00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:00.461
It creates spasms of uncertainty
for business owners.

00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:03.861
It threatens our nation's credit
and standing in the world,

00:03:03.861 --> 00:03:06.361
and the longer it goes on, the
more frequently this

00:03:06.361 --> 00:03:10.728
brinksmanship is inflicted, the
more we'll see markets react,

00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:13.227
businesses put off plans to
spend and hire,

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:15.895
and unemployment claims tick up.

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:19.594
The hundreds of thousands of
hard-working civil servants who

00:03:19.594 --> 00:03:22.661
go even longer without pay will
worry that they won't be able

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:26.461
to cover their bills, and that
their own creditworthiness

00:03:26.461 --> 00:03:29.528
will be ruined for no good
reason at all.

00:03:29.528 --> 00:03:31.561
And I want to thank all the
neighbors and local business

00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:34.027
owners who've shown acts of
kindness to these Americans

00:03:34.027 --> 00:03:36.094
who serve their country.

00:03:36.094 --> 00:03:38.928
I ask that same spirit of
citizenship from lenders

00:03:38.928 --> 00:03:41.161
who do business with these
folks, because they're being

00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:43.928
punished enough through no fault
of their own.

00:03:43.928 --> 00:03:46.594
So let's pass a budget, put
people back to work,

00:03:46.594 --> 00:03:49.294
and end this Republican
shutdown.

00:03:49.294 --> 00:03:52.061
Let's pay our bills and prevent
an economic shutdown.

00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:55.994
Then let's get back to the work
of the American people because

00:03:55.994 --> 00:03:58.361
there's so much else we should
be focusing our energies

00:03:58.361 --> 00:03:59.961
on right now.

00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:03.761
We've got to create more jobs,
we've got kids to educate,

00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:06.227
we've got an immigration system
to fix.

00:04:06.227 --> 00:04:08.428
We've got more troops to bring
home and a middle class

00:04:08.428 --> 00:04:12.361
to rebuild, and opportunity to
restore.

00:04:12.361 --> 00:04:15.061
There's so much America has
going for it in this new

00:04:15.061 --> 00:04:18.628
century, and as always, this
country works better when

00:04:18.628 --> 00:04:20.795
we work together.

00:04:20.795 --> 00:04:23.661
Thank you, and have a great
weekend.
