The President:
It's been one week since
tragedy visited Tucson, Arizona.

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:13.800
We properly spent much of the
week mourning the victims and

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.900
remembering their lives.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.066
We also discovered stories
that serve to lift us up --

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:24.000
stories of heroism and bravery,
of courage and community --

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.033
stories that remind us that
we are one American family,

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:29.834
300 million strong.

00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:32.767
One of the places we saw that
sense of community on display

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:35.233
was on the floor of the
House of Representatives,

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:39.400
where Gabby Giffords, who
inspires us with her recovery,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.233
is deeply missed
by her colleagues.

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:46.033
One by one, Representatives from
all parts of the country and all

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:50.266
points of view rose in common
cause to honor Gabby and the

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:55.500
other victims, and to reflect on
our shared hopes for this country.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.533
As shrill and discordant as
our politics can be at times,

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:03.066
it was a moment that reminded
us of who we really are --

00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:06.700
and how much we
depend on one another.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.900
While we can't escape our
grief for those we've lost,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.800
we carry on now,
mindful of those truths.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.433
We carry on because we have to.

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:20.367
After all, this is still a time of
great challenges for us to solve.

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:23.000
We've got to grow jobs
faster, and forge a stronger,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.033
more competitive economy.

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:26.734
We've got to shore
up our budget,

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:28.667
and bring down our deficits.

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:30.600
We've got to keep
our people safe,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.400
and see to it that the American
Dream remains vibrant and alive

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.667
for our children and
our grandchildren.

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:40.900
These are challenges
I believe we can meet.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.400
And I believe we can do it in a
way worthy of those who sent us

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.133
here to serve.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:50.500
So as business resumes, I look
forward to working together in

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.300
that same spirit of common cause
with members of Congress from

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.667
both parties -- because before
we are Democrats or Republicans,

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:01.800
we are Americans.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.300
And as we perform the
work of this nation,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.433
my prayer is that we
stay true to our words,

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:11.533
and turn to those examples
of heroism, and courage,

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:16.433
and perseverance, to bring
out the better in all of us.

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:19.266
Thanks for listening, and
have a wonderful weekend.
