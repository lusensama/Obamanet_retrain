00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.178
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.547
This week, America came
together to salute our

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:17.851
veterans - to express our
appreciation to all who

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.620
served so that we
might live free.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.789
But our gratitude should
extend beyond what our

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.392
veterans have done
for us in the past.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.561
It should remind us of our
responsibility to serve them

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.030
as well as they
have served us.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.566
It should compel us to keep
our veterans central to the

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.703
ongoing work of this nation.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.239
In recent years, we've made
historic investments to

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.275
boost the VA budget,
expand veterans' benefits,

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:45.245
and improve care for
our wounded warriors.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.914
We've now slashed the
disability claims backlog by

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:50.950
nearly 90 percent
from its peak.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.653
We're reducing the outrage
of veterans' homelessness

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:55.488
and we've helped tens of
thousands of veterans get

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.290
off the streets.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.794
The veterans' unemployment
rate is down to 3.9 percent

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:03.763
- even lower than
the national average.

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:06.332
Of course, we're
not satisfied.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.601
We've still got more work
to do - and I've directed my

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.304
Administration to keep doing
everything it can to fulfill

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:13.273
our promise to our veterans.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.708
But this isn't just a
job for government alone.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:18.278
We all have a role to play.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.213
Less than one percent of
Americans are serving

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.014
in uniform.

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:23.016
So it's true most Americans
don't always see and

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.819
appreciate the incredible
skills and assets that our

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.821
veterans can offer.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.089
But every American should
know that our veterans are

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:33.993
some of the most talented,
capable people in the world.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.863
They've mastered skills and
technologies and leadership

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:40.400
roles that are impossible to
teach off the battlefield.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.735
They know how to
get stuff done.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.271
And as our veterans will
tell you themselves,

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.540
they're not finished
serving their country.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.442
They're teachers
and doctors,

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:52.445
engineers and entrepreneurs,
social workers

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.147
and community leaders.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.282
They serve in statehouses
across the country

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:57.951
and in Congress.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:00.353
As I tell small business
owners and CEOs on a regular

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:04.791
basis, if you want to get
the job done, hire a vet.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.659
Every sector,
every industry,

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.662
every community in this
country can benefit from the

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:12.499
incredible talents
of our veterans.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.668
Our troops and veterans
give us their very best.

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:19.506
That's what a soldier named
Captain Florent Groberg proved.

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:21.875
Three years ago, on
patrol in Afghanistan,

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:25.912
Flo saw a suicide bomber
coming toward his unit.

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:28.314
Without hesitating, Flo
grabbed him by his vest and

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.250
helped push him
to the ground.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.385
When the bomb went off,
Flo was badly injured,

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.954
and four of his
comrades were killed.

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:38.258
But many more were saved
because of Flo's sacrifice.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:41.528
Flo represents the very best
of America - and this week,

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:43.329
I was proud to present him
with the Medal of Honor

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.131
for his actions.

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:49.068
Veterans like Flo, they
deserve our undying gratitude.

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:51.337
They deserve the chance to
keep serving the country

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.773
they risked
everything to defend.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:56.376
And so we must come together
to keep giving them that

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.478
chance, not just
on Veterans Day,

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:01.180
but on every single
day of the year.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.284
May God bless all those who
serve and all who have given

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:06.052
their lives for our country.

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:10.089
And may God bless the
United States of America.
