The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.900
On Friday, I visited
Fort Bliss in Texas,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.333
where I met with some of our
extraordinary men and women in

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:16.066
uniform to mark the second
anniversary of the end of major

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.300
combat in Iraq.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.767
It was a chance to thank our
troops for the outstanding work

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:23.033
they've done over
the last decade.

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:26.200
Fort Bliss is home to soldiers
who took part in every major

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.433
phase of the Iraq War -- from
the initial assault on Baghdad;

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:33.033
to the years of
fighting block by block;

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.333
to the partnership with the
Iraqi people that helped give

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.834
them a chance to forge
their own destiny.

00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:40.367
And while the war itself remains
a source of controversy here at

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:43.500
home, one thing will
never be in doubt --

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.600
the members of our armed forces
are patriots in every sense

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.000
of the word.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.133
They met every mission and
performed every task that was

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:55.200
asked of them with precision,
commitment and skill.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.133
And now, with no Americans
fighting in Iraq,

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:01.667
it's my privilege on behalf of
a grateful nation to once again

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:05.834
congratulate these men and
women on a job well done.

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:09.700
This anniversary is a chance to
appreciate how far we've come.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.133
But it's also a reminder that
there is still difficult work

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.767
ahead of us in Afghanistan.

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:17.200
Some of the soldiers I met at
Fort Bliss had just come home

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.600
from the battlefield, and others
were getting ready to ship out.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.133
We've broken the Taliban's
momentum in Afghanistan,

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:27.333
and begun the transition
to an Afghan lead.

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.200
Next month, the last of the
troops I ordered as part of the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.166
surge against the Taliban
will come home, and by 2014,

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:37.734
the transition to Afghan
lead will be complete.

00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:41.066
But as long as we have a
single American in harm's way,

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.033
we will continue to do
everything in our power to keep

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:45.934
them safe and help them succeed.

00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:48.667
That means giving them a clear
mission and the equipment they

00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:50.533
need on the front lines.

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:53.934
But it also means taking care of
our veterans and their families.

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:55.900
Because no one who fights for
this country should have to

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.700
fight for a job or a roof over
their head when they come home.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.300
I also told our soldiers at
Bliss that part of honoring

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.200
their service means
strengthening the nation they

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.600
fought so hard to protect.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.133
As we turn the page
on a decade of war,

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:13.033
it's time to do some
nation-building here at home.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.667
My grandfather's generation
came back from World War II and

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:18.233
helped form the backbone of
the greatest middle-class

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:19.767
in history.

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:23.066
They helped this country come
back stronger than before.

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:25.367
Today's veterans have the
skills, the discipline,

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:28.200
and the leadership skills to
do the exact same thing --

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.867
and it's our job to
give them that chance.

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:33.467
It's time to build a nation that
lives up to the ideals that so

00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:35.400
many Americans
have fought for --

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.333
a nation where they can realize
the dream they sacrificed

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:39.934
to protect.

00:02:39.934 --> 00:02:43.367
We need to rebuild our
roads and runways and ports.

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:46.433
We need to lay broadband lines
across this country and put our

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:49.667
veterans back to work as cops
and firefighters in communities

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:50.967
that need them.

00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:54.133
And we need to come together to
make America a place where hard

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:57.367
work is rewarded and anyone
willing to put in the effort can

00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:59.400
make it if they try.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.533
That's how we can
honor our troops.

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:04.133
That's the welcome
home they've earned.

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:06.133
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
