00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.767
The President:
Today, like millions of other families across America,

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:11.500
Michelle, Malia, Sasha and I
will sit down to share a

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.367
Thanksgiving filled with family
and friends --

00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:17.400
and a few helpings of food and
football, too.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.800
And just as folks have done in
every Thanksgiving since the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.266
first, we'll spend some time
taking stock of what we're

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.834
thankful for: the God-given
bounty of America,

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:29.300
and the blessings of one
another.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.100
This is also a holiday that
captures that distinctly

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.033
American impulse to give
something of ourselves.

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:38.734
Even as we speak, there are
countless Americans serving at

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:41.667
soup kitchens and food pantries;
contributing to their

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:45.600
communities; and standing guard
around the world.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.367
And in a larger sense, that's
emblematic of what Americans

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:50.166
have always done.

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:54.133
We've come together and done what's required to make tomorrow

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.633
better than today.

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:57.433
That's who we are.

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:00.500
Consider our journey since that
first Thanksgiving.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.767
We're among the world's
youngest of peoples,

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:05.200
but time and again, we have
boldly and resiliently led the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.633
way forward.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.633
Against tough odds, we're a
people who endure --

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:13.200
who explored and settled a vast
and untamed continent;

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.967
who built a powerful economy and
stood against tyranny in all its

00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:19.867
forms; who marched and fought
for equality,

00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:24.000
and connected a globe with our
science and imagination.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.433
None of that progress was
predestined.

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:28.200
None of it came easily.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.200
Instead, the blessings for which
we give thanks today are the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.934
product of choices made by our
parents, and grandparents,

00:01:34.934 --> 00:01:38.800
and generations before -- whose determination and sacrifice

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.767
ensured a better future for us.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:46.967
This holiday season, we must
resolve once more to do the same.

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:50.000
This is not the hardest
Thanksgiving America has ever faced.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.100
But as long as many members of
our American family are hurting,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.333
we've got to look out for one
another.

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:58.166
As long as many of our sons and
daughters and husbands and wives

00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:02.633
are at war, we've got to support
their mission and honor their service.

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:04.500
And as long as many of our
friends and neighbors are

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.967
looking for work, we've got to
do everything we can to

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:11.266
accelerate this recovery and
keep our economy moving forward.

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:12.834
And we will.

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:16.000
But we won't do it as any one
political party.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.867
We've got to do it as one
people.

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:19.233
And in the coming weeks and
months,

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:21.166
I hope that we can work
together,

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:24.200
Democrats and Republicans and
Independents alike,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.266
to make progress on these and
other issues.

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:30.066
That's why, next week, I've
invited the leadership of both

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:33.333
parties to the White House for a
real and honest discussion --

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:36.033
because I believe that if we
stop talking at one another,

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:39.934
and start talking with one
another, we can get a lot done.

00:02:39.934 --> 00:02:42.133
For what we are called to do
again today isn't about

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:43.967
Democrats or Republicans.

00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:45.500
It's not about left or right.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.767
It's about us.

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:49.433
It's about what we know this
country is capable of.

00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:52.800
It's about what we want America
to be in this new century.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800
A vibrant nation that makes sure
its children are the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.800
best-educated in the world.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.800
A healthy, growing economy that
runs on clean energy and creates

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.900
the jobs of tomorrow.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.200
A responsible government that
reduces its deficits.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.300
An America where every citizen
is able to go as far as he or

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.033
she desires.

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:13.433
We can do all this, because
we've done it before.

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:16.367
We're made of the same sturdy
stuff as the travelers who first

00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:18.834
sat down to that Thanksgiving dinner,

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:22.166
and all who came after -- who worked, and sacrificed,

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:24.734
and invested, because they believed that their efforts

00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:27.166
would make the difference for us.

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:28.467
That's who we are.

00:03:28.467 --> 00:03:31.767
We shape our own destiny with
conviction and compassion,

00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:34.200
and clear and common purpose.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.734
We honor our past and press
forward with the knowledge that

00:03:36.734 --> 00:03:39.133
tomorrow will be better than
today.

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:40.200
We're Americans.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.467
That's the vision we won't lose
sight of.

00:03:42.467 --> 00:03:45.467
That's the legacy that falls to
our generation.

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:49.166
That's the challenge that
together, we are going to meet.

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:53.533
To every American, I am thankful
for the privilege of being your President.

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:56.033
To all of our service members
stationed around the world,

00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:58.333
I am honored to be your
Commander-in-Chief.

00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:00.533
And from the Obama family to
yours,

00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:02.734
have a very Happy Thanksgiving.

00:04:02.734 --> 00:04:03.734
Thanks.
