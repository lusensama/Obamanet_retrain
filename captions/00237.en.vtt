00:00:08.528 --> 00:00:09.861
President Obama:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:12.361
I want to spend a couple minutes
talking with you today about

00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:13.861
our economy.

00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:16.027
We've just come through the
worst recession since the Great

00:00:16.027 --> 00:00:18.928
Depression, and while our
economy as a whole has been

00:00:18.928 --> 00:00:21.561
growing and adding
private sector jobs,

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:23.361
too many folks are still
struggling to get back

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:25.061
on their feet.

00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:27.161
I wish I could tell you
there was a quick fix to our

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:28.328
economic problems.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:31.994
But the truth is, we didn't
get into this mess overnight,

00:00:31.994 --> 00:00:34.227
and we won't get
out of it overnight.

00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:36.027
It's going to take time.

00:00:36.027 --> 00:00:38.594
The good news is, when it comes
to job creation and economic

00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:42.795
growth, there are certain
things we know we can do.

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:44.461
Now, government is not
-- and should not be --

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.994
the main engine of job
creation in this country.

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:48.828
That's the role of
the private sector.

00:00:48.828 --> 00:00:51.661
But one thing government can
do is partner with the private

00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:55.661
sector to make sure that every
worker has the necessary skills

00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:58.361
for the jobs they're
applying for.

00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:01.061
On Wednesday, I announced
commitments by the private

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:04.361
sector, colleges, and the
National Association of

00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:08.428
Manufacturers that will make it
possible for 500,000 community

00:01:08.428 --> 00:01:11.928
college students to get a
manufacturing credential that

00:01:11.928 --> 00:01:14.628
has the industry's
stamp of approval.

00:01:14.628 --> 00:01:16.328
If you're a company
that's hiring,

00:01:16.328 --> 00:01:19.394
you'll know that anyone who
has this degree has the skills

00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:20.895
you're looking for.

00:01:20.895 --> 00:01:23.127
If you're a student
considering community college,

00:01:23.127 --> 00:01:25.695
you'll know that your diploma
will give you a leg up in the

00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:27.361
job market.

00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:29.494
On Monday, I'll travel
to North Carolina,

00:01:29.494 --> 00:01:31.461
where I'll meet with my
Jobs Council and talk about

00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:35.227
additional steps we can take to
spur private sector hiring in

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:38.227
the short-term and ensure our
workers have the skills and

00:01:38.227 --> 00:01:40.728
training they need
in this economy.

00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:43.328
There are also a few other
things we know will help grow

00:01:43.328 --> 00:01:46.828
our economy, and give people
good jobs that support a

00:01:46.828 --> 00:01:48.661
middle-class lifestyle.

00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:51.261
We know that a quality education
is a prerequisite for success,

00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:54.227
so we're challenging states and
school districts to improve

00:01:54.227 --> 00:01:57.428
teaching and learning, and
making it a national goal to

00:01:57.428 --> 00:02:00.161
once again have the highest
proportion of college graduates

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:02.561
in the world by 2020.

00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:04.928
We know that more and more jobs
are being created in the clean

00:02:04.928 --> 00:02:07.661
energy sector, so we're
investing in wind power,

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:11.027
solar power, and biofuels that
will make us less dependent on

00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:14.761
foreign oil and clean up our
planet for our children.

00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:16.994
These are steps we know will
make a difference in people's

00:02:16.994 --> 00:02:20.628
lives -- not just twenty years
from now, or ten years from now,

00:02:20.628 --> 00:02:23.161
but now, and in
the months to come.

00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:26.461
In the end, the folks I hear
from in letters or meet when I

00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:30.061
travel across the country --
they aren't asking for much.

00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:32.594
They're just looking for a
job that covers their bills.

00:02:32.594 --> 00:02:35.561
They're looking for a
little financial security.

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:37.528
They want to know that if they
work hard and live within their

00:02:37.528 --> 00:02:39.994
means, everything
will be all right.

00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:42.394
They'll be able to get
ahead, and give their kids a

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:43.795
better life.

00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:47.494
That's the dream each of us has
for ourselves and our families.

00:02:47.494 --> 00:02:49.294
And so long as I have the
privilege of serving as

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:52.928
President, I'll keep fighting to
put that dream within the reach

00:02:52.928 --> 00:02:54.494
of all Americans.

00:02:54.494 --> 00:02:55.961
Have a great weekend, everybody.
