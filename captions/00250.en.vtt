00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:10.795
The President:
I'm talking with you
from Miami, Florida,

00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:12.994
where I'm visiting Miami
Central High School,

00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:16.561
a school that's turning itself
around on behalf of its kids.

00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:19.194
I came here with Jeb Bush,
former governor of this state,

00:00:19.194 --> 00:00:22.461
because he and I share the view
that education isn't a partisan

00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:25.227
issue -- it's an American issue.

00:00:25.227 --> 00:00:28.161
But in a larger sense, this is a
moment when we've all got to do

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:31.294
what the students and the
teachers are doing here.

00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:33.127
We've got to step up our game.

00:00:33.127 --> 00:00:35.961
Our top priority right now has
to be creating new jobs and

00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:38.961
opportunities in a fiercely
competitive world.

00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:41.895
And this week, we received
very good news on that front.

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:44.361
We learned that the unemployment
rate has fallen to its lowest

00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:50.361
level in nearly two years as our
economy added another 222,000

00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:53.361
private sector
jobs last month.

00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:55.928
Now, we have a lot
more work to do,

00:00:55.928 --> 00:00:57.795
not just for the Americans
who still don't have jobs,

00:00:57.795 --> 00:01:00.994
but for the millions more who
still don't have the right job

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:04.094
or all the work they need to
live out the American Dream.

00:01:04.094 --> 00:01:06.328
But the progress we're seeing
says something about the

00:01:06.328 --> 00:01:10.994
determination and ingenuity of
our people and our businesses.

00:01:10.994 --> 00:01:13.795
What's also helping to fuel this
economic growth are the tax cuts

00:01:13.795 --> 00:01:16.695
that Democrats and Republicans
came together to pass in

00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:19.728
December and that I
signed into law --

00:01:19.728 --> 00:01:22.895
tax cuts that are already making
Americans' paychecks bigger and

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:25.695
allowing businesses to
write off their investments,

00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:28.661
freeing up more money
for job creation.

00:01:28.661 --> 00:01:31.227
Just as both parties cooperated
on tax relief that is now

00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:34.661
fueling job growth, we need to
come together around a budget

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:38.761
that cuts spending without
slowing our economic momentum.

00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:41.494
We need a government that
lives within its means without

00:01:41.494 --> 00:01:44.594
sacrificing job-creating
investments in education,

00:01:44.594 --> 00:01:47.428
innovation, and infrastructure.

00:01:47.428 --> 00:01:50.227
The budget I sent to Congress
makes these investments,

00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:52.861
but it also includes a
5-year spending freeze,

00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:57.728
and it will reduce our deficits
by $1 trillion over the next decade.

00:01:57.728 --> 00:02:00.261
In fact, the cuts I've proposed
would bring annual domestic

00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:04.561
spending to its lowest share of
the economy under any president

00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:06.594
in more than 50 years.

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:08.795
Over the last few weeks, Members
of Congress have been debating

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.361
their own proposals.

00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:13.227
And I was pleased that Democrats
and Republicans in Congress came

00:02:13.227 --> 00:02:16.761
together a few days ago and
passed a plan to cut spending

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:20.261
and keep the government
running for two more weeks.

00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:23.127
But we can't do business
two weeks at a time.

00:02:23.127 --> 00:02:25.461
It's not responsible, and it
threatens the progress our

00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:27.227
economy has been making.

00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:28.961
We've got to keep
that momentum going.

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:31.928
We need to come together,
Democrats and Republicans,

00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:36.127
around a long-term budget that
sacrifices wasteful spending

00:02:36.127 --> 00:02:39.928
without sacrificing the job-creating
investments in our future.

00:02:39.928 --> 00:02:42.628
My administration has already
put forward specific cuts that

00:02:42.628 --> 00:02:45.828
meet congressional
Republicans halfway.

00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:47.428
And I'm prepared to do more.

00:02:47.428 --> 00:02:49.961
But we'll only finish
the job together --

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:53.027
by sitting at the same table,
working out our differences,

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:55.027
and finding common ground.

00:02:55.027 --> 00:02:57.227
That's why I've asked Vice
President Biden and members of

00:02:57.227 --> 00:03:01.628
my Administration to meet with
the leaders of Congress going forward.

00:03:01.628 --> 00:03:04.161
Getting our fiscal house in
order can't just be something we

00:03:04.161 --> 00:03:08.094
use as cover to do away with the
things we dislike politically.

00:03:08.094 --> 00:03:10.695
And it can't just be
about how much we cut.

00:03:10.695 --> 00:03:14.294
It's got to be about how
we cut and how we invest.

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.961
We've got to be smart about it.

00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:18.895
Because if we cut back on the
kids I've met here and their

00:03:18.895 --> 00:03:22.961
education, we'd be risking the
future of an entire generation

00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:24.328
of Americans.

00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:26.828
And there's nothing
responsible about that.

00:03:26.828 --> 00:03:29.294
We've got to come together to
put America back on a fiscally

00:03:29.294 --> 00:03:32.994
sustainable course -- and make
sure that when it comes to the

00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:37.294
economy of our 21st century,
our children and our country are

00:03:37.294 --> 00:03:41.261
better-prepared than anyone
else in the world to take it on.

00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:42.961
Our future depends on it.

00:03:42.961 --> 00:03:45.461
That's not a Democratic or
a Republican challenge --

00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:47.194
it's an American challenge.

00:03:47.194 --> 00:03:49.661
And I'm confident
it's one we'll meet.

00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:50.828
Thanks for listening.
