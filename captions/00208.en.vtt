00:00:08.528 --> 00:00:09.628
The President:
Hi there.

00:00:09.628 --> 00:00:11.628
As you can see, I brought a
few things with me for this

00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:13.194
week's video.

00:00:13.194 --> 00:00:14.194
A padlock.

00:00:14.194 --> 00:00:15.661
A pair of boots.

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:16.795
A candle.

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:18.728
And a pair of socks.

00:00:18.728 --> 00:00:20.528
We are not having a yard sale.

00:00:20.528 --> 00:00:23.361
And these products may not
appear to have much in common.

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:28.094
But they're united by three
proud words: "Made in America."

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:32.061
They're manufactured by American
workers, in American factories,

00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:35.695
and shipped to customers
here and around the world.

00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:38.094
The companies that make these
products are part of a hopeful

00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:41.861
trend: they're bringing
jobs back from overseas.

00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:45.461
You've heard of outsourcing
-- well, this is insourcing.

00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:48.494
And in this make or break moment
for the middle class and those

00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:50.494
working to get into
the middle class,

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:52.795
that's exactly the kind
of commitment to country

00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:54.561
that we need.

00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:57.227
This week, I invited executives
from businesses that are

00:00:57.227 --> 00:01:00.561
insourcing jobs to a
forum at the White House.

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:04.628
These are CEOs who take pride in
hiring people here in America,

00:01:04.628 --> 00:01:06.494
not just because it's
increasingly the right thing to

00:01:06.494 --> 00:01:09.328
do for their bottom line, but
also because it's the right

00:01:09.328 --> 00:01:12.728
thing to do for their workers
and for our communities and

00:01:12.728 --> 00:01:14.361
for our country.

00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:18.027
I told those CEOs what I'll
tell any business leader:

00:01:18.027 --> 00:01:20.961
ask yourself what you can do
to bring more jobs back to the

00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:23.461
country that made
your success possible.

00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:26.428
And I'll make sure that you've
got a government that does

00:01:26.428 --> 00:01:29.828
everything in its power
to help you succeed.

00:01:29.828 --> 00:01:31.294
That's why, in the
next few weeks,

00:01:31.294 --> 00:01:34.628
I will put forward new tax
proposals that reward companies

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:37.227
that choose to do the right
thing by bringing jobs home and

00:01:37.227 --> 00:01:40.394
investing in America -- and
will eliminate tax breaks for

00:01:40.394 --> 00:01:42.928
companies that
move jobs overseas.

00:01:42.928 --> 00:01:45.895
It's also why on Friday, I
called on Congress to help me

00:01:45.895 --> 00:01:48.861
make government
work better for you.

00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:51.094
Right now, we have a
21st century economy,

00:01:51.094 --> 00:01:54.961
but we've still got a government
organized for the 20th century.

00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:57.795
Over the years, the needs
of Americans have changed,

00:01:57.795 --> 00:01:59.695
but our government has not.

00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:01.461
In fact, it's gotten
even more complex.

00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:03.528
And that has to change.

00:02:03.528 --> 00:02:05.861
That's why I asked Congress to
reinstate the authority that

00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:08.428
past presidents have had to
streamline and reform the

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.027
Executive Branch.

00:02:10.027 --> 00:02:12.261
This is the same sort of
authority that every business

00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:15.761
owner has to make sure that
his or her company keeps pace

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:17.127
with the times.

00:02:17.127 --> 00:02:19.961
It's the same authority that
presidents had for over 50 years

00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:21.795
-- until Ronald Reagan.

00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:25.194
And let me be clear: I will only
use this authority for reforms

00:02:25.194 --> 00:02:28.494
that result in more
efficiency, better service,

00:02:28.494 --> 00:02:30.194
and a leaner government.

00:02:30.194 --> 00:02:32.594
These changes will make it
easier for small business owners

00:02:32.594 --> 00:02:35.394
to get the loans and support
they need to sell their products

00:02:35.394 --> 00:02:36.795
around the world.

00:02:36.795 --> 00:02:38.994
For example, instead of forcing
small business owners to

00:02:38.994 --> 00:02:41.728
navigate the six departments
and agencies in the federal

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:44.227
government that focus
on business and trade,

00:02:44.227 --> 00:02:45.961
we'll have one department.

00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:49.194
One place where entrepreneurs
can go from the day they come up

00:02:49.194 --> 00:02:51.961
with an idea and need a patent,
to the day they start building a

00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:54.194
warehouse, to the day
they're ready to ship their

00:02:54.194 --> 00:02:56.194
products overseas.

00:02:56.194 --> 00:02:58.828
And in the meantime, we're
creating a new website --

00:02:58.828 --> 00:03:02.494
BusinessUSA -- that will
serve as a one-stop shop with

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:05.861
information for businesses small
and large that want to start

00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:08.594
selling their stuff
around the world.

00:03:08.594 --> 00:03:10.628
This means that more small
business owners will see their

00:03:10.628 --> 00:03:12.294
hard work pay off.

00:03:12.294 --> 00:03:14.294
More companies will be
able to hire new workers.

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:17.895
And we'll be able to rebuild
an economy that's not known for

00:03:17.895 --> 00:03:20.695
paper profits or
financial speculation,

00:03:20.695 --> 00:03:23.861
but for making and selling
products like these.

00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:25.994
Products "Made in America."

00:03:25.994 --> 00:03:27.661
Thank you, and have
a great weekend.
