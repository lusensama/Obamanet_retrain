00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.678
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.514
My top priority as President
is to grow the economy

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.317
and help more hardworking
Americans get ahead.

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:20.253
And after the worst economic
crisis in our lifetimes,

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:23.823
our businesses have now
created 12.6 million

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.993
new jobs over the
past 63 months.

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:29.496
That's a record streak
of job creation.

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:33.099
And it's come as we've been
working to reform our schools,

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.969
revitalize manufacturing
and the auto industry,

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.139
revamp our job training
programs - and rework

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.408
our health care system,
covering more than

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:45.779
16 million uninsured
Americans so far.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:48.047
We've done all of this to
rebuild our economy on a new

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:51.684
foundation, a foundation
for growth that benefits

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:55.288
not only us, but our
kids, and their kids.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.290
Because we do live
in a new economy.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.126
And we've got to adapt to
make sure America leads

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.429
the way in this new
century, just like we did

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.397
in the last.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:07.066
Part of that means sparking
new sources of growth

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.770
and job creation that keep
us on the cutting edge.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.274
And one big way to do that
is through smart new trade

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:16.910
agreements that level the
playing field for our

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.113
workers, open new markets
for our businesses,

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:22.615
and hold other countries
to the kinds of high

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.485
standards that Americans
are proud to hold ourselves

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:27.287
to here at home.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:30.123
Simply put, America
has to write the rules

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.125
of the 21st century
economy in a way that

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.560
benefits American workers.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.096
If we don't, countries like
China will write those

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:40.333
rules in a way that
benefits their workers.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.569
Now, on Friday,
Republicans and Democrats

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.571
in the House of
Representatives voted

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:47.073
to help the United States
negotiate new trade deals

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:50.310
that are both free and
fair - deals that expand

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.745
opportunity for our workers
and our businesses alike.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.914
And that's good.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:57.350
These kinds of trade deals
say no to a race for

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.854
the bottom, for lower wages
and working conditions.

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:03.723
They're about starting a race
to the top, for higher wages,

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:06.059
and better working conditions,
stronger environmental

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:09.062
protections, and a
smarter way to crack down

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:12.866
on countries that break the
rules of the global economy.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.668
But that's not all we should
be doing for our workers.

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:18.638
Right now, something called
Trade Adjustment Assistance

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.740
provides vital support,
like job-training

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.676
and community college
education, to tens of thousands

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:26.913
of American workers each
year who were hurt by past

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:31.184
trade deals - the kind we're
not going to repeat again.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:33.620
Republicans and Democrats in
the Senate have voted to renew

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.523
this initiative, but so far,
the House of Representatives

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:39.926
has chosen to let it expire
in just a few months,

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:42.629
leaving as many as
100,000 American workers

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:43.630
on their own.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.633
For the sake of those
workers, their families,

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:49.736
and their communities, I urge
those Members of Congress who

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:53.239
voted against Trade Adjustment
Assistance to reconsider,

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.708
and stand up for
American workers.

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.710
Because these smart new
trade deals aren't just

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.712
about growing our economy
and supporting good

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:00.713
new American jobs.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:02.715
This is about the kind
of country we want

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:04.717
to build for our kids
and our grandkids.

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:07.420
And if I did not think
that smart new trade deals

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.689
were the right thing to
do for working families,

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.424
I wouldn't be
fighting for it.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:13.459
This is the right
thing to do.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.929
Trade that's fair and
free and smart will

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.931
grow opportunity for
our middle class.

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:20.166
It will help us restore
the dream we share,

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:22.669
and make sure that every
American who works hard

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.604
has a chance to get ahead.

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:27.640
That's a cause worth
fighting for - today,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.609
and every day I have
the honor of serving

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.511
as your President.

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.813
Thanks everybody, and
have a great weekend.
