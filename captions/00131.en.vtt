00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:07.266
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.333
Over the past few weeks, I've
been visiting with Americans

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.300
across the country to talk about
what we need to do to secure

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.867
a better bargain for
the middle class.

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:17.266
We need to rebuild an economy
that rewards hard work

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:21.900
and responsibility; an economy
built firmly on the cornerstones

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.700
of middle-class life.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.700
Good jobs.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.700
A good education.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.166
A home of your own.

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.600
A secure retirement.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.800
And quality, affordable health
care that's there

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.667
when you need it.

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:35.900
Right now, we're well on our
way to fully implementing

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.300
the Affordable Care Act.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.166
And in the next few months,
we'll reach a couple milestones

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.300
with real meaning for
millions of Americans.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.767
If you're one of the 85% of
Americans who already have

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:50.900
insurance, you've already got
new benefits and protections

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.834
under this law that
you didn't before.

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:57.233
Free checkups, mammograms,
and contraceptive care.

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:00.200
Discounted prescription
medicine on Medicare.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.000
The fact you can stay on your
parents' plan until you turn 26.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.400
And much, much more.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.700
And it's okay if you're not a
fan of the Affordable Care Act -

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.266
you can take advantage
of these things anyway.

00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:16.000
If you don't have insurance,
beginning on October 1st,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.800
private plans will actually
compete for your business.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.066
You can comparison shop in an
online marketplace, just like

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:26.400
you would for cell phone
plans or plane tickets.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.200
You may be eligible for new tax
credits to help you afford

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.166
the plan that's right for you.

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.900
And if you're in the up to half
of all Americans who've been

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.533
sick or have a preexisting
condition, this law means that

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:41.834
beginning January 1st, insurance
companies have to cover you -

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:44.200
and they can't use your medical
history to charge

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.934
you more than anybody else.

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:50.533
You can find out more about the
law, and how to sign up to buy

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:54.367
your own coverage right
now at HealthCare.gov.

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:57.533
Tell your friends and neighbors
without insurance about it, too.

00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:00.767
And tell your kids that
there's a new, easy way to buy

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:04.834
affordable plans specifically
tailored to young people.

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:07.734
Many Members of Congress, in
both parties, are working hard

00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:10.300
to inform their constituents
about these benefits,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.734
protections, and
affordable plans.

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:15.567
But there's also a group of
Republicans in Congress working

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:19.133
hard to confuse people, and
making empty promises that

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:22.367
they'll either shut down the
health care law, or, if they

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:25.734
don't get their way, they'll
shut down the government.

00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:27.300
Think about that.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.100
They're actually having a debate
between hurting Americans

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.934
who will no longer be denied
affordable care just because

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:36.433
they've been sick - and harming
the economy and millions

00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:37.667
of Americans in the process.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:41.433
And many Republicans are more
concerned with how badly this

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:44.233
debate will hurt them
politically than they are with

00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:47.400
how badly it'll
hurt the country.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.633
A lot of Republicans seem to
believe that if they can gum

00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:51.934
up the works and make this law
fail, they'll somehow

00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:53.734
be sticking it to me.

00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:56.300
But they'd just be
sticking it to you.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.734
Some even say that if you call
their office with questions

00:02:58.734 --> 00:03:01.967
about the law, they'll
refuse to help.

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:03.233
Call me old-fashioned -
but that's

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:04.633
lousy constituent service.

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:06.700
And it's not what you deserve.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.900
Your health insurance isn't
something to play politics with.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.467
Our economy isn't something
to play politics with.

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:13.500
This is not a game.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.734
This is about the
economic security

00:03:15.734 --> 00:03:18.033
of millions of families.

00:03:18.033 --> 00:03:20.333
See, in the states where
governors and legislatures

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.700
and insurers are working
together to implement this law

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.867
properly - states like
California, New York, Colorado

00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:30.600
and Maryland - competition and
consumer choice are actually

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.066
making insurance affordable.

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:35.166
So I'm going to keep doing
everything in my power to make

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:38.100
sure this law works
as it's supposed to.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.266
Because in the United States of
America, health insurance isn't

00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:43.100
a privilege - it is your right.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.033
And we're going to
keep it that way.

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:47.033
Thanks.

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:48.033
And have a great weekend.
