00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.767
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:14.767
This week, I delivered my
State of the Union Address.

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:17.700
Today, here's the
three-minute version.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.800
After four years of economic
growth with eight million new

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.533
private sector jobs, our
unemployment rate is the lowest

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.066
it's been in more
than five years.

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.233
And with the
economy speeding up,

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:32.400
companies say they intend to
hire more people this year.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.900
But while those at the top
are doing better than ever,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.467
average wages have
barely budged.

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:39.467
Inequality has deepened.

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:41.333
Too many Americans are working
harder and harder

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.233
just to get by.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:46.633
And too many still
aren't working at all.

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:49.166
Our job is to
reverse those trends.

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:53.033
It's time to restore opportunity
for all people - the idea that

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:56.166
no matter who you are, if you
work hard and live up to your

00:00:56.166 --> 00:01:00.300
responsibilities, you
can make it if you try.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.600
The opportunity agenda I laid
out on Tuesday has four parts.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.266
This week, I took
them on the road.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.133
Job one is more new jobs:
jobs in construction

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:13.000
and manufacturing, jobs in
innovation and energy.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.033
In Wisconsin, I talked with
plant workers at GE about

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:19.233
part two: training more
Americans with the skills

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:21.500
to fill those new jobs.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.000
In Tennessee, I talked with
students about part three:

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.333
guaranteeing every child access
to a world-class education,

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.367
from early childhood,
through college,

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:32.433
and right into a career.

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:34.200
And with steelworkers
in Pittsburgh,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.533
and retail workers in Maryland,
I laid out part four:

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:41.834
making sure hard work pays
off for men and women,

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:45.266
with wages you can live on,
savings you can retire on,

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:48.934
and health insurance that's
there for you when you need it.

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:51.333
These ideas will strengthen
the middle class and help more

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:54.500
people work their way
into the middle class.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.200
Some of them will
require Congress.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.233
But wherever I can take steps
to expand opportunity for more

00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:03.600
families on my own, I will.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.734
I'm going to ask business
leaders, education leaders,

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:07.433
and philanthropic leaders to
partner with

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:09.667
us to advance these goals.

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:13.166
And every single day, I'm going
to fight for these priorities -

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:16.200
to shift the odds back in favor
of more working and middle-class

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.100
families, and to keep America a
place where you can always make

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.100
it if you try.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.200
Thanks.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.600
Have a great weekend.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600
And enjoy the Super Bowl.
