00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.145
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:14.447
One of the things that makes
America so strong is our

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.716
spirit of innovation.

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:19.486
Our drive to invent and
harness new technologies to

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.955
tackle our greatest
challenges.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.624
It's how we won the race to
invent the lightbulb and the

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:29.596
Internet; it's why we were
first to the Moon and Mars.

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:32.065
It's why I keep models of
American inventions like the

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:34.601
telegraph in
the Oval Office.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.470
It's a daily reminder of the
genius that's embedded in

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.607
our DNA; the way we've
always shaped the future

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:43.910
through our ideas
and discoveries.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.845
That's truer
than ever today,

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:48.815
with the constant stream of
new apps and tools and data

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:52.385
that are still changing the
way we live - from getting a

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.855
ride to paying our bills to
developing smarter ways to

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.024
combat climate change.

00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:01.094
That's why, next week, I'll
travel to Austin, Texas,

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.596
to visit South by Southwest.

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:05.765
It's an annual gathering of
some of our most creative

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:08.635
thinkers, coders, makers,
and entrepreneurs from

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:09.669
across the country.

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.705
And while I'm there, I'm
going to ask everyone for

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.974
ideas and technologies
that can help update our

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:19.145
government and our democracy
to be as modern and dynamic

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.213
as America itself.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:22.515
This has been a goal of
mine since

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.484
before I was President.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:27.854
On my campaign in 2008, we
saw how technology could

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:30.690
bring people together and
help them engage as citizens

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.292
in their own communities.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.294
So when I came to
the White House,

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.295
I wanted apply that
experience

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.230
to the federal government.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.032
It hasn't always been easy.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:41.034
And we've had some
bumps along the way.

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.036
But we've also
made good progress.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:45.004
Over the past few
years, for example,

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.173
we've done something that
government never has.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.175
We asked some of the
sharpest minds from

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.744
companies in Silicon Valley
and across the country to

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:54.614
come help us modernize the
federal government for the

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.683
way we live today.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:58.518
And they came
ready to serve,

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:01.020
tackling some of our biggest
challenges - like high-tech

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.889
special ops units.

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:04.958
These teams are partnering
with the government's

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.260
existing policy and
technical experts to

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.762
re-imagine the way we
do business and deliver

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:12.732
services that work
better and cost less.

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:15.001
Already, we've made it
easier for students to find

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.003
the college that's
right for them.

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:19.005
For immigrants to track
the green card and

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:21.074
naturalization
process online.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:23.743
For veterans to access
their medical records.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:25.979
And yes, after an
initial false start,

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.147
we've made it much easier
for tens of millions of

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:31.484
Americans to compare and buy
health insurance and the

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.920
peace of mind
that goes with it.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.689
That's what this is all
about - making sure our

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.126
government of the people and
by the people works better

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:42.795
for the people in
the 21st century.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.931
It's about Americans working
together to make a real

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.766
difference in
people's lives.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:49.335
Because the easiest thing to
do is to blame government

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.703
for our problems.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.705
Some people have made
a career out of that.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:56.376
But our founders trusted us
with the keys to this system

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:59.112
of self-government because
it's the best tool we've got

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:01.314
to settle our differences
and solve

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:03.283
our collective challenges.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:05.552
And it's only as
good as we make it.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:07.554
That's why I'm going
to Austin and South by

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:10.823
Southwest - to keep asking
everyone from all walks of

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:13.660
life, working inside or
outside of government,

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.663
to help us make this
democracy even stronger.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.398
And I hope you join us.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.400
Thanks everybody,
have a great weekend.
