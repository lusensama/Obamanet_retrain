00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:07.266
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.633
It's now been four years since a
crisis that began on Wall Street

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:13.767
spread to Main Street, hammering
middle-class families and

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:17.066
ultimately costing our
economy 9 million jobs.

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.300
Since then, we've
fought our way back.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.567
Our businesses have added
more than 5 million new jobs.

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:25.100
The unemployment rate has fallen
to the lowest level since I

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.567
took office.

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:28.433
Home values are rising again.

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:31.500
And our assembly lines
are humming once more.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.033
And to make sure America never
goes through a crisis like that

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:38.033
again, we passed tough new
Wall Street reform to end

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:40.900
taxpayer-funded
bailouts for good.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.533
Wall Street reform also created
the first-ever independent

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:47.900
consumer watchdog, whose sole
job is to look out for you.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.467
That means making sure you've
got all the information you need

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:53.934
to make important financial
decisions like buying a home or

00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:55.533
paying for college.

00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.500
And it means going after anyone
who tries to take advantage of

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.767
you, or rip you off.

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:03.300
Starting this month, that
includes the folks who come up

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.166
with your credit score.

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.600
If you haven't checked
out your credit score

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.333
recently, you should.

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.633
It can have a major
impact on your life.

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:13.934
It can determine whether or not
you qualify for a loan or what

00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:15.900
kind of interest
you have to pay.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.533
It can even affect your chances
of renting an apartment or

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.367
getting a job.

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:23.100
But here's the thing: the
companies that put your credit

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.734
score together
can make mistakes.

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:28.500
They may think you had a loan
or a credit card that was

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.800
never yours.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.367
They may think you were late
making a payment when you

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:33.834
were on time.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:37.266
And when they mess up,
you're the one who suffers.

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:39.400
Until this week, if
you had a complaint,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.934
you took it to the company.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.266
Sometimes they listened.

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:43.800
Sometimes they didn't.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.467
But that was pretty much it.

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:47.633
They were your only real hope.

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:49.333
Well, not anymore.

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.367
If you have a complaint about
your credit score that hasn't

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:53.467
been properly
addressed, you can go to

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:57.800
ConsumerFinance.gov/complaint
and let the consumer

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.433
watchdog know.

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:01.567
Not only will they bring your
complaint directly to the

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:04.033
company in question, they'll
give you a tracking number,

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:07.066
so you can check back and see
exactly what's being done on

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:08.500
your behalf.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.433
And fixing your credit score
isn't the only thing they

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:12.934
can help with.

00:02:12.934 --> 00:02:14.500
If you're opening
a bank account,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.767
trying to get a student loan, or
applying for a credit card and

00:02:17.767 --> 00:02:20.800
something doesn't seem right,
you can let them know and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.500
they'll check it out.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.667
If you're looking to buy a home,
and you want to know if you're

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:26.467
getting a fair deal
on your mortgage,

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:29.500
you can give them a call and
they'll get you an answer.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.433
Their only mission
is to fight for you.

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:35.066
And when needed,
they'll take action.

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:37.000
For example, alongside
other regulators,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.367
they recently ordered three big
credit card companies to return

00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:44.800
more than $400 million to folks
who were deceived or misled into

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.400
buying things they didn't
want or didn't understand.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.166
That's what Wall Street
reform is all about --

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:54.600
looking out for working families
and making sure that everyone is

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.633
playing by the same rules.

00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:59.734
Sadly, that hasn't been enough
to stop Republicans in Congress

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:01.734
from fighting these reforms.

00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:04.667
Backed by an army of
financial industry lobbyists,

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:07.066
they've been waging an
all-out battle to delay,

00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:10.600
de-fund and dismantle
these new rules.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.633
I refuse to let that happen.

00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:14.900
I believe that the free market
is one of the greatest forces

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.266
for progress in human history,
and that the true engine of job

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:20.200
creation in this country
is the private sector,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.900
not the government.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.600
But I also believe that the
free market has never been about

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.467
taking whatever you want,
however you can get it.

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:31.400
Alongside our innovative spirit,
America only prospers when we

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.867
meet certain obligations
to one another,

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:37.133
and when we all play by
the same set of rules.

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:40.166
We've come too far -- and
sacrificed too much --

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:44.200
to go back to an era of
top-down, on-your-own economics.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.867
And as long as I'm President,
we're going to keep moving this

00:03:46.867 --> 00:03:49.166
country forward so
that everyone --

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:51.567
whether you start a
business or punch a clock --

00:03:51.567 --> 00:03:55.867
can have confidence that if you
work hard, you can get ahead.

00:03:55.867 --> 00:03:57.867
Thanks and have a great weekend.
