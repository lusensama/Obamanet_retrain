00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:07.767
President Obama:
Recently, there have been
signs that the economy is

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:09.433
picking up steam.

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:13.200
Last month, we saw the strongest
job growth in five years,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.300
and have added more than
three-quarters of a million

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.700
private sector jobs
in just three months.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.100
But there are still too many
Americans who are either looking

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.400
for work, or struggling to pay
the bills and make the mortgage.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.033
Paychecks aren't
getting any bigger,

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:30.633
but the cost of everything from
groceries to college tuition

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:33.066
keeps on rising.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.133
Without a doubt, one of the
biggest burdens over the last

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.567
few months has been
the price of gasoline.

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:42.600
In many places, gas is
now more than $4 a gallon,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.266
meaning that you could be
paying more than $60 to fill

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.767
up your tank.

00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:49.133
These spikes in gas prices
are often temporary,

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.266
and while there are no
quick fixes to the problem,

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:54.567
there are a few steps we should
take that make good sense.

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:57.900
First, we should make sure that
no one is taking advantage of

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.767
consumers at the pump.

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:02.400
That's why we've launched a
task force led by the Attorney

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.333
General that has one job:
rooting out cases of fraud or

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.934
manipulation in the markets
that might affect gas prices,

00:01:09.934 --> 00:01:14.500
including any illegal activity
by traders and speculators.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.467
Second, we should increase safe
and responsible oil production

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:20.200
here at home.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.200
Last year, America's oil
production reached its highest

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.934
level since 2003.

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:26.667
But I believe that we
should continue to expand oil

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:30.433
production in America -- even
as we increase safety and

00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:32.166
environmental standards.

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.734
To do this, I'm directing
the Department of Interior to

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:38.033
conduct annual lease sales in
Alaska's National Petroleum

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:41.200
Reserve, while respecting
sensitive areas,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.367
and to speed up the evaluation
of oil and gas resources in the

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:46.400
mid and south Atlantic.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.667
We plan to lease new areas in
the Gulf of Mexico as well,

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:51.767
and work to create new
incentives for industry to

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:56.567
develop their unused leases
both on and offshore.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:59.300
We're also taking steps to give
companies time to meet higher

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.266
safety standards when it comes
to exploration and drilling.

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:05.734
That's why my Administration is
extending drilling leases in

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:08.367
areas of the Gulf that were
impacted by the temporary

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:12.700
moratorium, as well as certain
areas off the coast of Alaska.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.333
And to streamline that
permitting process,

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:18.333
I'm establishing a new team
to coordinate work on Alaska

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.266
drilling permits.

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:23.900
Finally, the third step we
should take is to eliminate the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.467
taxpayer subsidies we give
to oil and gas companies.

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:30.667
In the last few months, the
biggest oil companies made about

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:34.400
$4 billion in profits each week.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.200
And yet, they get $4 billion
in taxpayer subsidies each year.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.567
$4 billion at a time when
Americans can barely fill

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:44.166
up their tanks.

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:48.500
$4 billion at a time when we're
trying to reduce our deficit.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.600
This isn't fair,
it makes no sense.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.567
Before I was President, the CEOs
of these companies even admitted

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:57.233
that the tax subsidies
made no sense.

00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:00.400
Well, next week, there's a vote
in Congress to end these oil

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.900
company giveaways
once and for all.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.333
And I hope Democrats and
Republicans come together and

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:07.133
get this done.

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:09.533
The American people shouldn't be
subsidizing oil companies at a

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:12.233
time when they're making
near-record profits.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:14.767
As a nation, we should be
investing in the clean,

00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:17.800
renewable sources of energy that
are the ultimate solution to

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.734
high gas prices.

00:03:19.734 --> 00:03:22.400
That's why we're investing
in clean energy technology,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.667
helping businesses that
manufacture solar panels and

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:28.400
wind turbines, and making sure
that our cars and trucks can go

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.266
further on a tank of gas -- a
step that could save families as

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:35.500
much as $3,000 at the pump.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.800
These are investments
worth making --

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.700
investments that
will save us money,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.600
reduce our dependence
on foreign oil,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.800
and protect the health
and safety of our planet.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.934
That's an energy
policy for the future,

00:03:46.934 --> 00:03:49.233
and it's what I'll be
fighting for in the weeks and

00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:50.934
months to come.

00:03:50.934 --> 00:03:51.900
Thanks.
