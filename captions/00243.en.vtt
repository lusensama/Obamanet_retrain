00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:08.091
The President:
This is a time of year when
people get together with family

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:12.291
and friends to observe Passover
and to celebrate Easter.

00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:15.191
It's a chance to give thanks for
our blessings and reaffirm our

00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:19.058
faith, while spending time
with the people we love.

00:00:19.058 --> 00:00:20.958
We all know how
important that is --

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.124
especially in hard times.

00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:25.925
And that's what a lot of
people are facing these days.

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.491
Even though the economy is
growing again and we've seen

00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:31.024
businesses adding jobs
over the past year,

00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:33.591
many are still looking for work.

00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:35.692
And even if you haven't
faced a job loss,

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:37.591
it's still not easy out there.

00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:39.191
Your paycheck isn't
getting bigger,

00:00:39.191 --> 00:00:41.591
while the cost of everything
from college for your kids to

00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:44.958
gas for your car keeps going up.

00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.191
That's something on a lot of
people's minds right now,

00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:49.825
with gas prices at $4 a gallon.

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:52.692
It's just another burden when
things were already pretty tough.

00:00:52.692 --> 00:00:56.024
Now, whenever gas prices
shoot up, like clockwork,

00:00:56.024 --> 00:00:58.591
you see politicians
racing to the cameras,

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.591
waving three-point
plans for $2 gas.

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:05.158
You see people trying to grab
headlines or score a few points.

00:01:05.158 --> 00:01:08.091
The truth is, there is no silver
bullet that can bring down gas

00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:10.258
prices right away.

00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:12.391
But there are a few
things we can do.

00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:15.258
This includes safe and
responsible production of oil at

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:17.525
home, which we're pursuing.

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:20.024
In fact, last year, American oil
production reached its highest

00:01:20.024 --> 00:01:23.325
level since 2003.

00:01:23.325 --> 00:01:26.458
On Thursday, my Attorney General
also launched a task force with

00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:30.858
just one job: rooting out cases
of fraud or manipulation in the

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:33.858
oil markets that might
affect gas prices,

00:01:33.858 --> 00:01:37.991
including any illegal activity
by traders and speculators.

00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:40.158
We're going to make sure that no
one is taking advantage of the

00:01:40.158 --> 00:01:43.425
American people for their
own short-term gain.

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:47.291
And another step we need to take
is to finally end the $4 billion

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:52.091
in taxpayer subsidies we give to
the oil and gas companies each year.

00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:55.291
That's $4 billion of your money
going to these companies when

00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:58.425
they're making record profits
and you're paying near record

00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:00.425
prices at the pump.

00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:02.191
It has to stop.

00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:04.525
Instead of subsidizing
yesterday's energy sources,

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.725
we need to invest in tomorrow's.

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:09.758
We need to invest in
clean, renewable energy.

00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:13.058
That's the long term
answer that we need.

00:02:13.058 --> 00:02:14.925
That's the key to helping
families at the pump and

00:02:14.925 --> 00:02:17.591
reducing our dependence
on foreign oil.

00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:19.425
We can see that promise already.

00:02:19.425 --> 00:02:22.058
Thanks to a historic agreement
we secured with all the major

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:25.425
auto companies, we're raising
the fuel economy of cars and

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:30.191
trucks in America, using hybrid
technology and other advances.

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:33.792
As a result, if you buy a new
car in the next few years,

00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:38.491
the better gas mileage is going to
save you about $3,000 at the pump.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.124
But we need to do more.

00:02:40.124 --> 00:02:42.925
We need to harness the potential
I've seen at promising start-ups

00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:46.425
and innovative clean energy
companies across America.

00:02:46.425 --> 00:02:48.725
And that's at the heart of a
debate we're having right now in

00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:51.391
Washington about the budget.

00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:55.291
Both Democrats and Republicans
believe we need to reduce the deficit.

00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:56.792
That's where we agree.

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:59.925
The question we're
debating is, how we do it?

00:02:59.925 --> 00:03:02.792
I've proposed a balanced
approach that cuts spending

00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:06.358
while still investing in things
like education and clean energy

00:03:06.358 --> 00:03:09.158
that are so critical to creating
jobs and opportunities for the

00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:10.825
middle class.

00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:14.024
It's a simple idea: we need to
live within our means while at

00:03:14.024 --> 00:03:16.692
the same time investing
in our future.

00:03:16.692 --> 00:03:20.024
That's why I so strongly
disagree with a proposal in

00:03:20.024 --> 00:03:24.758
Congress that cuts our investments
in clean energy by 70%.

00:03:24.758 --> 00:03:26.858
Yes, we've got to get rid
of wasteful spending --

00:03:26.858 --> 00:03:29.991
and make no mistake, we're going
through every line of the budget

00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:32.158
scouring for savings.

00:03:32.158 --> 00:03:35.258
But we can do that without
sacrificing our future.

00:03:35.258 --> 00:03:37.558
We can do that while still
investing in the technologies

00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:40.491
that will create jobs and allow
the United States to lead the

00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:42.591
world in new industries.

00:03:42.591 --> 00:03:44.758
That's how we'll not
only reduce the deficit,

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:48.692
but also lower our dependence on
foreign oil, grow our economy,

00:03:48.692 --> 00:03:51.425
and leave our children
a safer planet.

00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:53.858
And that's what our
mission has to be.

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:57.124
Thanks for listening, and have
a wonderful Easter weekend.
