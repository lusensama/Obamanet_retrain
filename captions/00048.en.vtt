00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:10.744
The President: Hello,
everybody.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:14.914
Today marks an historic
anniversary-70 years since

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:18.118
the Allied victory in
Europe during World War II.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.920
On V-E Day after
the Nazi surrender,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.256
people swarmed the streets
of London and Paris and

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:26.326
Moscow, and the cloud of
fear that had hung for so

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:29.162
many years finally lifted.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:32.465
Here at home, from small
towns to Times Square,

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.434
crowds gathered
in celebration,

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.169
singing and
dancing with joy.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:39.105
There would still be three
more months of deadly

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:40.840
fighting in the Pacific.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.277
But for a few hours, the
world rejoiced in the hope

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:46.579
of peace.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.581
General Eisenhower announced
the news with little

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:49.983
fanfare.

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:52.685
"The Mission of this
Allied Force," he said,

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:53.686
"was fulfilled."

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.980
But his simple message
belied the extraordinary

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.727
nature of the Allied
victory-and the staggering

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:01.728
human loss.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:06.032
For over five years, brutal
fighting laid waste to an

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:08.034
entire continent.

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:11.438
Mothers, fathers,
children were murdered in

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.473
concentration camps.

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:15.742
By the time the guns
fell silent in Europe,

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.745
some 40 million people
on the continent had

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:21.181
lost their lives.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.884
Today, we pay tribute
to all who served.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.520
They were patriots, like my
grandfather who served in

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.759
Patton's Army-soldiers,
sailors, airmen, marines,

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.495
coast guard, merchant
marines-and the women of the

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:40.166
WACs and the WAVES
and every branch.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.169
They risked their lives, and
gave their lives so that we,

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:46.306
the people the world
over, could live free.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:49.042
They were women who stepped
up in unprecedented numbers,

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.344
manning the home
front, and-like my

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:55.181
grandmother-building
bombers on assembly lines.

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:58.084
This was the generation
that literally saved the

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:03.056
world-that ended the war and
laid a foundation for peace.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:05.859
This was the generation that
traded in their uniforms for

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.261
a college education so
they could marry their

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:11.364
sweethearts, buy homes,
raise children and build the

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:14.968
strongest middle class
the world has ever known.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.504
This was the generation that
included heroes like the

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:21.508
Tuskegee Airmen, the Navajo
Code Talkers and the

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:26.446
Japanese-Americans of the
442nd Regiment-and who

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.982
continued the fight for
freedom here at home,

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.751
expanding equality and
opportunity and justice

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:34.287
for minorities and women.

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:37.423
We will be forever grateful
for what these remarkable

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:41.461
men and women did, for the
selfless grace they showed

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.696
in one of our darkest hours.

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:46.165
But as we mark this
70th anniversary,

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.768
let's not simply
commemorate history.

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:51.671
Let's rededicate ourselves
to the freedoms for which

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.106
they fought.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:55.909
Let's make sure that we keep
striving to fulfill our

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.912
founding ideals-that we're a
country where no matter who

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:02.348
we are or where we're from
or what we look like or who

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.984
we love, if we work hard
and take responsibility,

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:08.655
every American will have the
opportunity to make of our

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:10.557
lives what we will.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:12.392
Let's stand united
with our allies,

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:14.561
in Europe and beyond,
on behalf of our common

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:19.966
values-freedom, security,
democracy, human rights,

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:22.936
and the rule of law around
the world-and against

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:26.239
bigotry and hatred in all
their forms so that we give

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.108
meaning to that
pledge: "Never forget.

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:31.277
Never again."

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.279
Most of all let's salute
once more to that generation

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.015
of Americans whose courage
and sacrifice are the reason

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:38.751
we're here today in
peace and freedom.

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:41.754
Their spirit lives on in
our brave men and women in

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:45.024
uniform and families who
continue to defend the very

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:47.660
freedoms our parents and
grandparents fought for.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.430
As Americans grateful for
their service let's truly

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.968
honor them on this day and
every day with the gratitude

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:57.637
they have earned and the
respect that they deserve.

00:03:57.637 --> 00:04:00.807
May God bless them and may
he continue to bless the

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:02.141
United States of America.
