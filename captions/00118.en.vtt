00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:07.333
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.767
On Thursday, I visited
a steel plant in Cleveland, Ohio

00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:12.033
to talk about what we're doing

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.867
to rebuild our economy
on a new foundation

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:17.900
for stronger, more durable 
economic growth.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.834
One area where we've made great
progress is American energy.

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:24.700
After years of talk about
reducing our dependence

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.467
on foreign oil,
we are actually poised

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:30.400
to control our
own energy future.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.700
Shortly after I took office,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.600
we invested in new
American technologies

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.900
to reverse our dependence
on foreign oil

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.367
and double our
wind and solar power.

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:42.633
And today, we generate more
renewable energy than ever -

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:46.233
with tens of thousands of good,
American jobs to show for it.

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:48.867
We produce more
natural gas than anyone -

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:52.600
and nearly everyone's energy
bill is lower because of it.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.367
And just this week, we learned
that for the first time

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:58.367
in nearly two decades,
the United States of America

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:01.700
now produces more of our
own oil here at home

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.300
than we buy from
other countries.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.767
That's a big deal.

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:09.800
That's a tremendous step towards
American energy independence.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.200
But this is important, too:

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.100
we reached this
milestone in part

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.367
not only because we're
producing more energy,

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:18.333
but because we're
wasting less energy.

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.900
We set new fuel standards
for our cars and trucks

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.300
so that they'll go twice
as far on a gallon of gas

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.300
by the middle
of the next decade.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.967
That's going to
save an average driver

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:31.433
more than $8,000 at the pump
over the life of a new car.

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:33.934
We also launched initiatives
to put people to work

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:36.800
upgrading our homes,
businesses, and factories

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.333
so that they
waste less energy.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.600
That's going to save
our businesses money

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.300
on their energy bills -

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.133
that's money they can
use to hire more workers.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.533
Here's another thing.

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:51.033
Between more clean energy,
and less wasted energy,

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:53.300
our emissions of dangerous
carbon pollution

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.467
are actually falling.

00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:57.300
That's good news
for anyone who cares

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.734
about the world
we leave to our kids.

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:01.667
And while our carbon
emissions have been dropping,

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:03.834
our economy has been growing.

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:06.500
Our businesses have created
7.8 million new jobs

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.600
in the past 44 months.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.166
It proves that the old argument

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:12.600
that we can't strengthen the economy 
and be good stewards

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.166
of our planet at the same
time is a false choice.

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:17.500
We can do both.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.633
And we have to do both.

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:21.033
More good jobs.

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:23.300
Cheaper and cleaner
sources of energy.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.600
A secure energy future.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.934
Thanks to the grit
and resilience of American

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:29.400
businesses and the
American people,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.734
that's where we're heading.

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:32.633
And as long as I'm President,
that's where we're going

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:35.600
to keep heading - to leave
our children a stronger economy,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.834
and a safer planet.

00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:39.834
Thanks,
and have a great weekend.
