00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.911
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:14.381
It's our job as citizens to
make sure we keep pushing

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:18.051
this country we love toward
our most cherished ideals -

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:21.187
that all of us are created
equal, and all of us deserve

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.156
an equal shot.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.759
This week, my Administration
took new steps to bring us

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.428
a little closer to that goal.

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:31.197
Almost 50 years ago,
Republicans and Democrats

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:35.368
in Congress came together to
pass the Fair Housing Act.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.405
It's a law that says landlords
can't turn away tenants

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:42.776
solely because of their race,
religion, sex, national

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.444
origin, or disability.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:48.047
And it made a difference
in this country.

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:52.385
Still, the work of the Fair
Housing Act remains unfinished.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.554
Just a few weeks ago, the
Supreme Court ruled that

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.790
policies segregating
minorities in poor

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.392
neighborhoods, even
unintentionally,

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.294
are against the law.

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:04.063
The Court recognized what
many people know to be true

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:07.500
from their own lives: that
too often, where people

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.803
live determines what
opportunities they

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.604
have in life.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:14.741
In some cities, kids living
just blocks apart lead

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.943
incredibly different lives.

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:20.013
They go to different schools,
play in different parks,

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:24.184
shop in different stores, and
walk down different streets.

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:27.020
And often, the quality of
those schools and the safety

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.423
of those parks and streets
are far from equal -

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.425
which means those kids
aren't getting an equal

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.527
shot in life.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:38.598
That runs against the values
we hold dear as Americans.

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.800
In this country,
of all countries,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.802
a person's zip code
shouldn't decide their destiny

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.005
We don't
guarantee equal outcomes,

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:49.909
but we do strive to guarantee
an equal shot at opportunity -

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.146
in every neighborhood,
for every American.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:55.782
Now, the Fair Housing
Act also says that this

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.518
isn't the responsibility
of a landlord alone -

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:01.421
local governments have
a role to play, too.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:03.423
That's why, this week, my
Administration announced

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:05.425
that we'll make it
easier for communities

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.126
to implement this law.

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:09.696
We're using data on housing
and neighborhood conditions

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:14.000
to help cities identify the
areas that need the most help.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.002
We're doing more to
help communities meet

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.303
their own goals.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:20.340
Plus, by opening this
data to everybody,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.909
everyone in a community -
not just elected officials -

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.377
can weigh in.

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:26.513
If you want a bus stop
added near your home,

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.515
or more affordable
housing nearby,

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:32.118
now you'll have the data
you need to make your case.

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:34.654
These actions won't make
every community perfect.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:37.891
That's something we all have to
strive for in our own lives.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.493
But they will help make
our communities stronger

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:41.494
and more vibrant.

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.764
And they'll help keep this a
country where kids from

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:48.134
every background can grow up
knowing that no matter who

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:50.904
you are, what you look
like, or where you live,

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.339
you can write your
own story.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.542
That's the America I love.

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:58.011
And it's the America
I'll keep fighting for.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.679
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
