00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:08.734
The President:
Today, I'd like to speak with
you about the ongoing and urgent

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:12.100
efforts to avoid a first-ever
default and get our fiscal house

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.667
in order.

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:15.867
Republicans in the House of
Representatives just spent

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:19.500
precious days trying to pass
a plan that a majority of

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.066
Republicans and Democrats in the
Senate had already said they

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.734
wouldn't vote for.

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:26.433
It's a plan that wouldn't
solve our fiscal problems,

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:28.867
but would force us to
re-live this crisis in just a

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:30.867
few short months.

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:33.300
It would hold our economy
captive to Washington politics

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.000
once again.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.467
If anything, the past few
weeks have demonstrated

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:39.367
that's not acceptable.

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:43.633
Any solution to avoid
default must be bipartisan.

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:46.567
It must have the support of both
parties that were sent here to

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.266
represent the American people
-- not just one faction of

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.800
one party.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.567
There are multiple ways
to resolve this problem.

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:57.333
Congress must find common ground
on a plan that can get support

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:01.633
from both parties in the
House and in the Senate.

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:05.000
And it's got to be a plan
that I can sign by Tuesday.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.367
The parties are not
that far apart here.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.800
We're in rough agreement on how
much spending we need to cut to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.433
reduce our deficit.

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:14.200
And we agree on a process
to tackle tax reform and

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.166
entitlement reform.

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.300
There are plenty of
ways out of this mess.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.467
But there is very little time.

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:23.400
We need to reach a compromise by
Tuesday so that our country will

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.000
have the ability to pay
its bills on time --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.200
bills like Social Security
checks, veterans' benefits,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.300
and contracts we've
signed with thousands of

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.367
American businesses.

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:35.700
If we don't, for
the first time ever,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.400
we could lose our country's
AAA credit rating.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.800
Not because we didn't have the
capacity to pay our bills --

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.533
we do -- but because we didn't
have a AAA political system

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.133
to match it.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:49.533
And make no mistake -- for
those who reflexively oppose tax

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:53.500
increases on anybody, a lower
credit rating could be a tax

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.700
increase on everybody -- we'd
all pay higher interest rates on

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.266
mortgages, car loans,
and credit cards.

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:04.600
That would be inexcusable,
and entirely self-inflicted

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.533
by Washington.

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:09.533
The power to solve
this is in our hands.

00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:12.200
All that's needed is a simple
vote that Democrats and

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.400
Republicans have
taken for decades,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.533
including all of the
leaders in Congress today.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:20.200
It was done 18 times
under President Reagan.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.867
Seven times under
George W. Bush.

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:25.533
And it must be done again now.

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:28.600
It's not a vote that allows
Congress to spend more money.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.767
Raising the debt ceiling simply
gives our country the ability to

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:35.333
pay the bills that Congress
has already racked up.

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:37.900
It gives the United States
of America the ability to

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.433
keep its word.

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:42.433
And it lets businesses and
our economy breathe a sigh

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:43.934
of relief.

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:46.567
On Monday night, I asked you
to make your voice heard in

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:47.834
this debate.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.000
And the response
was overwhelming.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.300
One of the emails we received
was from a woman named

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.367
Kelly Smith, who wanted to send
this message to Washington:

00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:59.367
"I keep my home
clean," Kelly wrote.

00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:02.900
"I work hard at a full time job,
give my parents any monies I can

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.367
so they can afford
their medications,

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:07.900
I pay my bills and by
all appearances I'm a

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.000
responsible person.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.266
All I'm asking is that
you be responsible.

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:16.700
I have my house in order and all
I'm asking is that you get yours

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.800
the same way."

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.166
Here in Washington, we need
to get our house in order.

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:25.567
And I have to say, Democrats
in Congress and some Senate

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:27.934
Republicans have been listening
and have shown themselves

00:03:27.934 --> 00:03:31.333
willing to make compromises
to solve this crisis.

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.667
Now all of us -- including
Republicans in the House of

00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:36.633
Representatives -- need to
demonstrate the same kind of

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:40.467
responsibility that the
American people show every day.

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:43.000
The time for putting
party first is over.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.734
The time for compromise
on behalf of the American

00:03:45.734 --> 00:03:47.834
people is now.

00:03:47.834 --> 00:03:48.800
Thank you.
