The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.781
Earlier this week, I visited
with students at Georgia Tech to

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.150
talk about the importance of
higher education in the new

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.187
economy, and how we can
make it more affordable.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.923
In an economy increasingly
built on innovation,

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:28.228
the most important skill you
can sell is your knowledge.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.497
That's why higher education
is, more than ever,

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:33.400
the surest ticket
to the middle class.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.435
But just when it's never
been more important,

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.071
it's also never
been more expensive.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.874
The average undergrad who
borrows to pay for college ends

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:45.512
up graduating with about
$28,000 in student loan debt.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.481
That's why my Administration has
worked hard to make college

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.183
more affordable.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:53.153
We expanded tax credits
and Pell Grants,

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:56.389
enacted the largest reform
to student loan programs in

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.626
history, and fought to keep
interest rates on student

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:01.461
loans low.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.731
We've acted to let millions of
graduates cap loan payments at

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.766
10 percent of their income,
so they don't have to choose

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:10.470
between paying the rent and
paying back their debt.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.440
I've sent Congress my plan to
bring the cost of community

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.777
college down to zero - because
two years of higher education

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:22.348
should be as free and universal
as high school is today.

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:26.119
But all of us - elected
officials, universities,

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.356
business leaders - everybody -
needs to do more to bring down

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.825
college costs.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.327
Which is why this week, I
unveiled another way that we can

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:37.197
help more Americans
afford college.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.833
It doesn't involve any new
spending or bureaucracy.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:43.803
It's a simple declaration of
values - what I call a Student

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:45.705
Aid Bill of Rights.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:48.508
It says that every student
deserves access to a quality,

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:50.143
affordable education.

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:53.279
Every student should be able to
access the resources to pay

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.581
for college.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:58.952
Every borrower has the right to
an affordable repayment plan.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:02.789
And every borrower has the right
to quality customer service,

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.458
reliable information,
and fair treatment,

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.695
even if they struggle
to repay their loans.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:09.696
That's it.

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:11.631
Just a few simple principles.

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.534
But if we all rally
around these principles,

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.903
there's a lot that
colleges, lenders,

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:20.173
and the people you sent to
Washington and to your state

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:24.377
legislatures can do to realize
them across the country.

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:27.981
So if you believe in a Student
Aid Bill of Rights that will

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:31.184
help more Americans pay
for a quality education,

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:32.385
I'm asking you to visit

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:35.989
WhiteHouse.gov/CollegeOpportunit y.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.324
Sign your name to
this declaration.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:41.895
Tell your families, and your
friends, and fellow students.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:44.464
I'm going to ask Members
of Congress, and lenders,

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:47.800
and as many business
leaders as I can find.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.169
Because making sure that
students aren't saddled with

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.339
debt before they even get
started in life is in all

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.608
our interests.

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:59.178
In America, a higher education
cannot be a privilege reserved

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:00.179
for only the few.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.550
It has to be available to
everybody who's willing to work

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.984
for it.

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.953
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
