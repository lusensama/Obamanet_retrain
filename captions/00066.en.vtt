00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:11.745
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.114
It's the holidays-a
season to give thanks

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.515
for our many blessings.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.884
The love of family.

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:19.786
The joy of good
friends.

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:22.122
The bonds of
community.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.157
The freedom we
cherish as Americans.

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:28.395
The peace and justice
we seek in the world.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.797
As we go about our days,
as we gather with loved

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:34.033
ones and friends, it's
important to remember:

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:37.570
our way of life-the freedom,
prosperity and security

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.873
that we enjoy as
Americans-is not

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.809
a gift that is
simply handed to us.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.779
It has to be earned-by
every generation.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:48.214
And no one sacrifices more
to preserve our blessings

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:51.618
than our extraordinary
men and women in uniform.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:53.620
That's why, on Monday,
I'll be visiting

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.089
our troops at Joint Base
McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.992
in New Jersey-to salute
them for their service

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.728
and thank them for
their sacrifices.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.197
Since our nation was
attacked on 9/11, these

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:06.433
men and women, like so
many others in uniform,

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:09.803
have met every mission
we've asked of them.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.639
They deployed to
Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.074
In more than a decade of
war, this 9/11 Generation

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:17.076
has worked with the Afghan
people to help them

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:19.145
reclaim their communities
and prevent terrorist

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:21.514
attacks against
our own country.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.550
Now, many of our troops
are returning from

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.718
Afghanistan, and on
Monday, I'll be proud

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.921
to help welcome
them home.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.923
That's because, this
month, our combat mission

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.258
in Afghanistan
will be over.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.260
Our war in
Afghanistan is coming

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.261
to a responsible
end.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.864
Of course, the end of
our combat mission

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:40.033
in Afghanistan doesn't mean
the end of challenges

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.534
to our
security.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:43.536
We'll continue to work
with Afghans to make sure

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.372
their country is stable
and secure and is never

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:49.676
again used to launch
attacks against America.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:51.644
The troops I'll visit on
Monday have been part

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.980
of our mission to degrade
and ultimately destroy ISIL

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.748
in Iraq and Syria.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:57.750
They've been supporting
our efforts in West Africa

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.120
to fight the Ebola
epidemic and save lives.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.958
Because in times of crisis
and challenge, the world

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.960
turns to America
for leadership.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.529
And when the world calls
on America, we call

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.065
on the brave men and women of
our armed forces to do what

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:13.900
no one else can.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.236
So this holiday season,
as we give thanks for the

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:18.404
blessings in our own
lives, let's also give

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.974
thanks to our men and
women in uniform who make

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.876
those blessings
possible.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.878
Even as some are coming
home for the holidays,

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:27.146
many more will be far
from their families, who

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:29.349
sacrifice along
with them.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.618
There are so many ways we
can express our gratitude

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:33.620
to our troops, their
families and our

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.756
veterans-everyone
can do something.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.458
To find out what
you can do,

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:41.794
just go to
JoiningForces.gov.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:45.164
As a nation, as Americans,
let's always keep striving

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:47.133
to serve them as
well as they have

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:48.835
always served us.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.004
Thanks, have a great
weekend, and God bless

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.684
our troops and
their families.
