00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:10.428
Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.428 --> 00:00:12.695
It was five years ago this week
that a financial crisis

00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:16.194
on Wall Street spread to Main
Street, and very nearly turned

00:00:16.194 --> 00:00:18.728
a recession into a depression.

00:00:18.728 --> 00:00:21.294
In a matter of months, millions
of Americans were robbed

00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:25.728
of their jobs, their homes,
their savings - after a decade

00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:27.728
in which they'd already been
working harder and harder

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:28.728
to just get by.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:32.861
It was a crisis from which
we're still trying to recover.

00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:35.494
But thanks to the grit and
determination of the American

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.628
people, we are
steadily recovering.

00:00:37.628 --> 00:00:39.728
Over the past three and a half
years, our businesses have

00:00:39.728 --> 00:00:42.628
created seven and a
half million new jobs.

00:00:42.628 --> 00:00:44.428
Our housing market is healing.

00:00:44.428 --> 00:00:47.194
We've become less
dependent on foreign oil.

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:51.294
Health care costs are growing
at the slowest rate in 50 years.

00:00:51.294 --> 00:00:53.994
And in just over a week,
millions of Americans without

00:00:53.994 --> 00:00:56.027
health care will be able to get
covered for

00:00:56.027 --> 00:00:58.861
less than $100 a month.

00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:00.828
So our economy is
gaining traction.

00:01:00.828 --> 00:01:02.728
And we're finally tackling
threats to middle-class

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:07.227
prosperity that Washington
neglected for far too long.

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:10.828
But as any middle-class family
listening right now knows,

00:01:10.828 --> 00:01:13.261
we've got a long way to go to
get to where we need to be.

00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:17.994
And after five years spent
digging out of crisis, the last

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:22.695
thing we need is for Washington
to manufacture another.

00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:26.161
But that's what will happen in
the next few weeks if Congress

00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:28.895
doesn't meet two deadlines.

00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:32.328
First: the most basic
Constitutional duty Congress

00:01:32.328 --> 00:01:34.961
has is passing a budget.

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:37.961
But if it doesn't pass one
before September 30th -

00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:42.161
a week from Monday - the
government will shut down.

00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:45.528
And so will many services
the American people expect.

00:01:45.528 --> 00:01:49.027
Military personnel, including
those deployed overseas, won't

00:01:49.027 --> 00:01:51.061
get their paychecks on time.

00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:53.994
Federal loans for rural
communities, small business

00:01:53.994 --> 00:01:57.561
owners, and new home
buyers will be frozen.

00:01:57.561 --> 00:01:59.795
Critical research into
life-saving discoveries

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:02.594
and renewable energy will
be immediately halted.

00:02:02.594 --> 00:02:08.294
All of this will be prevented if
Congress just passes a budget.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:12.127
Second: Congress must authorize
the Treasury

00:02:12.127 --> 00:02:14.461
to pay America's bills.

00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:18.261
This is done with a simple,
usually routine vote to raise

00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:20.628
what's called the debt ceiling.

00:02:20.628 --> 00:02:24.161
Since the 1950s, Congress has
always passed it, and every

00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:27.628
President has signed it -
Democrats and Republicans,

00:02:27.628 --> 00:02:30.294
including President Reagan.

00:02:30.294 --> 00:02:33.928
And if this Congress doesn't do
it within the next few weeks,

00:02:33.928 --> 00:02:37.328
the United States will default
on its obligations and put our

00:02:37.328 --> 00:02:40.328
entire economy at risk.

00:02:40.328 --> 00:02:44.394
This is important: raising the
debt ceiling is not the same

00:02:44.394 --> 00:02:46.928
as approving more spending.

00:02:46.928 --> 00:02:50.561
It lets us pay for what
Congress already spent.

00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:54.761
It doesn't cost a dime, or
add a penny to our deficit.

00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:57.261
In fact, right now, our deficits
are already falling

00:02:57.261 --> 00:02:59.494
at the fastest rate since the
end of World War II.

00:02:59.494 --> 00:03:02.895
And by the end of this year,
we'll have cut our deficits

00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:06.594
by more than half
since I took office.

00:03:06.594 --> 00:03:09.928
But reducing our deficits and
debt isn't even what the current

00:03:09.928 --> 00:03:12.961
standoff in Congress 
seems to be all about.

00:03:12.961 --> 00:03:16.728
The fact is Democrats and some
reasonable Republicans are

00:03:16.728 --> 00:03:19.194
willing to raise the debt
ceiling and pass a sensible

00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:22.361
budget - one that cuts spending
on what we don't need so we can

00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:24.428
invest in what we do.

00:03:24.428 --> 00:03:27.294
And I want to work with those
Democrats and Republicans

00:03:27.294 --> 00:03:30.127
on a better bargain for
the middle class.

00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:33.561
But there's also a faction on
the far right of the Republican

00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:35.961
party who've convinced their
leadership to threaten

00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:38.961
a government shutdown if they
can't shut off

00:03:38.961 --> 00:03:41.261
the Affordable Care Act.

00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:44.428
Some are actually willing to
plunge America into default

00:03:44.428 --> 00:03:48.528
if they can't defund the
Affordable Care Act.

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:49.761
Think about that.

00:03:49.761 --> 00:03:53.127
They'd actually plunge this
country back into recession -

00:03:53.127 --> 00:03:55.761
all to deny the basic security
of health care

00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:56.928
to millions of Americans.

00:03:56.928 --> 00:04:00.294
Well, that's not happening.

00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:01.828
And they know it's
not happening.

00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:05.361
The United States of America
is not a deadbeat nation.

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:07.428
We are a compassionate nation.

00:04:07.428 --> 00:04:09.461
We are the world's
bedrock investment.

00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:11.761
And doing anything to
threaten that

00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:14.294
is the height of irresponsibility.

00:04:14.294 --> 00:04:16.661
That's why I will not negotiate
over the full faith and credit

00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:18.394
of the United States.

00:04:18.394 --> 00:04:21.461
I will not allow anyone to harm
this country's reputation,

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.461
or threaten to inflict economic
pain on millions of our own

00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:28.494
people, just to make
an ideological point.

00:04:28.494 --> 00:04:31.528
So, we are running out
of time to fix this.

00:04:31.528 --> 00:04:34.094
But we could fix it tomorrow.

00:04:34.094 --> 00:04:37.795
Both houses of Congress can take
a simple vote to pay our bills

00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:43.294
on time, then work together
to pass a budget on time.

00:04:43.294 --> 00:04:46.661
Then we can declare an end to
governing by crisis and govern

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:49.761
responsibly, by putting our
focus back where it should

00:04:49.761 --> 00:04:53.661
always be - on creating new
jobs, growing our economy,

00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:55.961
and expanding opportunity not
just for ourselves,

00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:58.561
but for future generations.

00:04:58.561 --> 00:04:59.561
Thanks.
