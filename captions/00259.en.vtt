00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:09.033
The President:
This week, Congress passed
-- and I signed into law --

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:12.567
an essential economic package
that will help grow our economy,

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:16.033
spur businesses, and
jumpstart job creation.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.900
Instead of a New Years Day tax
hike on the vast majority of

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.567
Americans, two million Americans
who've lost their jobs through

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:25.834
no fault of their own will now
know with certainty that they

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:28.467
won't lose their emergency
unemployment insurance at the

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:30.033
end of the month.

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:33.000
Eight million college students
who'd otherwise face a tuition

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.567
hike next semester will continue
having access to the American

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:38.834
Opportunity Tax Credit.

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:43.000
12 million families with 24
million children will benefit

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.033
from extensions of the Earned
Income Tax Credit and the Child

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:47.367
Tax Credit.

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:50.767
And millions of entrepreneurs
who've been waiting to invest in

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:53.600
their businesses will receive
new tax incentives to help them

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.367
expand, buy new equipment,
or make upgrades,

00:00:57.367 --> 00:01:00.333
freeing up money to
hire new workers.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.867
This package, which is so
important for our economy at

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:07.233
this pivotal time, was the
product of hard negotiations.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:11.066
Like any negotiations, there was
give and take on both sides.

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.834
But I'm heartened by our ability
to come together to do what's

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:16.967
best for middle class
families across this country,

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:19.133
and for our economy as a whole.

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.533
Before Congress breaks
for the holidays,

00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:23.233
I'm also hopeful we can come
together on another urgent

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:25.500
national priority
-- and that is,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.767
the new START treaty that
will reduce the world's nuclear

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:31.033
arsenals and make
America more secure.

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:34.500
25 years ago, the Soviet Union
and the United States each had

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.667
about 25,000 nuclear weapons.

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:40.533
In the decades since, that
number has been reduced by over

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:46.467
70%, and we've had on-site
inspections of Russian nuclear facilities.

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:48.934
That progress would not have
been possible without strategic

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:51.767
arms control treaties.

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:54.500
During the past year, however,
our old treaty with Russia

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.667
expired, and without a new one,
we won't be able to verify

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:00.633
Russia's nuclear arsenal,
which would undercut President

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:04.066
Reagan's call to
trust, but verify,

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:06.033
when it comes to
nuclear weapons.

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:08.700
Without a new treaty, we'll risk
turning back the progress we've

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.066
made in our relationship
with Russia,

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:14.467
which is essential to enforce
strong sanctions against Iran,

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:17.567
secure vulnerable nuclear
materials from terrorists,

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:20.800
and resupply our
troops in Afghanistan.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.066
And we'll risk undermining
American leadership not only on

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:29.033
nuclear proliferation, but a host of
other challenges around the world.

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:31.900
Ratifying a treaty like START
isn't about winning a victory

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.100
for an administration
or a political party.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.533
It's about the safety and security
of the United States of America.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:41.367
That's why this treaty is
supported by both Presidents

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:44.700
Bill Clinton and
George H.W. Bush.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.600
That's why it's supported
by every living Republican

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.934
Secretary of State,
by our NATO allies,

00:02:50.934 --> 00:02:54.433
and the leadership of the
United States military.

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:57.767
Indeed, the Vice-Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

00:02:57.767 --> 00:03:00.767
General Hoss Cartwright, said
this week that the military

00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:04.333
needs this treaty, and
they need it badly.

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:07.300
And that's why every President
since Ronald Reagan has pursued

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.533
a treaty like START, and every
one that has been reviewed by

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:14.633
the Senate has passed with
strong bipartisan support.

00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:16.734
We've taken the time
to get this right.

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:19.133
The START treaty has now been
under review by the Senate for

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:20.800
over seven months.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.233
It's gone through 18 hearings.

00:03:23.233 --> 00:03:27.533
Nearly 1,000 questions have
been asked -- and answered.

00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:31.834
Several Republican Senators have
come out in support of ratification.

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:35.300
Meanwhile, further
delay comes at a cost.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.900
Every minute we drag our feet
is a minute that we have no

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.900
inspectors on the ground at
those Russian nuclear sites.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.900
It's time to get this done.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.734
It's time to show the same
spirit of common purpose on our

00:03:47.734 --> 00:03:51.633
security that we showed
this week on our economy.

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:55.066
It's time to remember the old
saying that politics stops at

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:56.934
the water's edge.

00:03:56.934 --> 00:03:59.600
That saying was coined
by a Republican Senator,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.200
Arthur Vandenberg, who partnered
with a Democratic President,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.934
Harry Truman, to pass landmark
national security measures at

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:09.533
the dawn of the Cold War.

00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:13.166
Today, over 60 years later, when
we're threatened not only by

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:16.533
nuclear weapons, but an
array of other dangers,

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:19.900
that's a principle we
must continue to uphold.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.900
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
