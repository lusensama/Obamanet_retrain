00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.278
The President: This week, our hearts are with

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:13.713
the people of Belgium,

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:15.715
as terrorist attacks claimed
the lives of

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:17.917
more than thirty people.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:20.286
Yesterday, we learned that
at least two Americans

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.921
were killed.

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.891
We pray for their
families and loved ones.

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:27.227
At least fourteen
Americans were injured.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:30.196
And we pray for their full
recovery - along with

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:33.700
everyone else affected
by these attacks.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.702
Earlier this week, I called
the Prime Minister of

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.904
Belgium and offered him our
full array of support in

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:40.240
bringing to justice any
terrorists involved in

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.609
planning or aiding this
unconscionable attack on

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.044
innocent men,
women, and children.

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:47.714
Belgium is a close friend
and ally of the United States.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.716
And when it comes
to our friends,

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.484
America has their back.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.888
Especially as we fight
the scourge of terrorism.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.023
More broadly, we're going
to continue to root out and

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:58.658
defeat ISIL.

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:00.860
We've been taking out ISIL
leadership, and this week,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.463
we removed one of their top
leaders from the battlefield

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.064
- permanently.

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:07.767
A relentless air campaign -
and support for forces in

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:11.204
Iraq and Syria who are
fighting ISIL on the ground

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.473
- has allowed us to take
approximately forty percent

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:17.944
of the populated territory
that ISIL once held in Iraq.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:19.946
We're supporting Iraqi
Security Forces who are

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:22.449
beginning to put pressure
on the ISIL stronghold of Mosul.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:25.718
And we will not stop until
ISIL's safe-havens

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.720
are destroyed.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.722
We're also working to
disrupt plots against the

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:32.625
United States and against
our friends and allies.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:35.128
A team of FBI agents is
on the ground in Belgium

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.096
supporting the
investigation.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.098
We've ramped up our
intelligence cooperation so

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.234
that we can root out
ISIL's operations.

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:44.671
And we constantly review our
homeland security posture to

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.273
remain vigilant against any
efforts to target

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.942
the United States.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:52.245
ISIL poses a threat to the
entire civilized world.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.247
That's why we've been
leading a truly global

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:57.383
coalition that will be
vital to our success.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:59.419
Secretary Kerry is leading
an international effort to

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.521
bring the Syrian
civil war to an end,

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.057
a critical piece of
restoring stability to that

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.892
war-torn part of the world.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:08.394
And next week, dozens of
world leaders will come here

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:11.664
to Washington for a summit
focused on nuclear security.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:14.167
We'll use that opportunity
to also review our joint

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:16.970
efforts against ISIL, and to
make sure the world remains

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.673
united in this effort
to protect our people.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.909
As we move forward
in this fight,

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.245
we have to wield another
weapon alongside our

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:27.914
airstrikes, our military,
our counterterrorism work,

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:29.582
and our diplomacy.

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:32.085
And that's the power
of our example.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:35.455
Our openness to refugees
fleeing ISIL's violence.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:38.024
Our determination to win
the battle against ISIL's

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:40.627
hateful and violent
propaganda - a distorted

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:43.229
view of Islam that aims to
radicalize young Muslims to

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.864
their cause.

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:47.567
In that effort, our most
important partners

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.369
are American Muslims.

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.105
That's why we have to reject
any attempt to stigmatize

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:55.241
Muslim-Americans, and their
enormous contributions to

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.510
our country and
our way of life.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.646
Such attempts are contrary
to our character,

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:03.182
to our values, and to our
history as a nation built

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:05.585
around the idea of
religious freedom.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.587
It's also counterproductive.

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.589
It plays right into the
hands of terrorists who want

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:11.724
to turn us against
one another;

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.726
who need a reason to recruit
more people

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:14.727
to their hateful cause.

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.963
I am a father.

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.464
And just like
any other parent,

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:21.134
the awful images from
Brussels draw my thoughts to

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:23.269
my own children's safety.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.605
That's also why you should
be confident that defeating

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:28.274
ISIL remains our top
military, intelligence,

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:30.710
and national
security priority.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.579
We will succeed.

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.781
The terrorists will fail.

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:37.817
They want us to abandon our
values and our way of life.

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:39.319
We will not.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.321
They want us to give in to
their vision of the future.

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.723
We will defeat
them with ours.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.858
Because we know that the
future belongs not to those

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:48.728
who seek only to destroy -
but to those who have the

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.531
courage to build.

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:53.533
Thanks.
