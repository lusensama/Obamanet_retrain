00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:06.967
President Obama:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:10.867
I'm speaking to you today from a
Chrysler plant in Toledo, Ohio,

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:15.000
where I just met with
workers, including Jill Opial.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.734
Jill was born and
raised here in Toledo.

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:21.400
Her mom and stepfather
retired from this plant.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.066
She met her husband here, and
now they have two children

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.734
of their own.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.700
This plant has not only been
central to the economy of this

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.633
town, it's been a part of the
lifeblood of this community.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:35.500
Now, the reason I came to Toledo
was to congratulate Jill and her

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.867
co-workers on the turnaround
they helped bring about at

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:40.934
Chrysler and throughout
the auto industry.

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:43.166
Today, each of the Big
Three automakers --

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:47.266
Chrysler, GM, and Ford -- is
turning a profit for the first

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.967
time since 2004.

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:53.633
Chrysler has repaid every
dime and more of what it owes

00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:57.433
American taxpayers for their
support during my presidency --

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:01.233
and it repaid that money six
years ahead of schedule.

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:05.166
And this week, we reached a deal
to sell our remaining stake.

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:10.100
And that means soon, Chrysler
will be 100% in private hands.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.066
Most importantly, all three
American automakers are now

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:16.400
adding shifts and creating jobs
at the strongest rate since

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.400
the 1990s.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.834
Chrysler has added a second
shift at the Jefferson North

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:23.967
plant in Detroit that
I visited last year.

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:27.166
GM is adding a third shift at
its Hamtramck plant for the

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.867
first time ever.

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:33.166
And GM plans to hire back all
of the workers they had laid off

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.567
during the recession.

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:36.800
That's remarkable when you
think about where we were just a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.533
couple of years ago.

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.967
When I took office, we were
facing the worst recession since

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:44.333
the Great Depression -- a
recession that hit our auto

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.800
industry particularly hard.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.300
In the year before
I was President,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.033
this industry lost
more than 400,000 jobs,

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:56.633
and two great, iconic American
companies, Chrysler and GM,

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:59.200
stood on the brink of collapse.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.100
Now, we had a few options.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.333
We could have done what a lot of
folks in Washington thought we

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.834
should do -- nothing.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.367
But that would have made a
bad recession worse and put a

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:10.800
million people out of work.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.800
I refused to let that happen.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.133
So I said, if GM and Chrysler
were willing to take the

00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:18.533
difficult steps of restructuring
and making themselves more

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:22.433
competitive, the American
people would stand by them --

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:24.333
and we did.

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:27.300
But we decided to do more than
rescue this industry from crisis

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.667
-- we decided to help it
retool for a new age,

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:33.033
and that's what we're doing
all across the country --

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:35.800
we're making sure America
can out-build, out-innovate,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.400
and out-compete the
rest of the world.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.867
That's how we'll build an
economy where you can see your

00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:44.967
incomes and savings rise again,
send your kids to college,

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:49.266
and retire with dignity,
security, and respect.

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:51.867
That's how we'll make sure we
keep that fundamental American

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:55.533
promise -- that if you work
hard and act responsibly,

00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:58.033
you'll be able to pass on
a better life to your kids

00:02:58.033 --> 00:02:59.400
and your grand kids.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.300
Now, we've got a ways to go.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.266
Even though our economy has
created more than two million

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.467
private sector jobs over the
past 15 months and continues to

00:03:06.467 --> 00:03:09.867
grow, we're facing
some tough headwinds.

00:03:09.867 --> 00:03:13.467
Lately, it's high gas prices,
the earthquake in Japan,

00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:17.066
and unease about the
European fiscal situation.

00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:18.934
That's going to happen
from time to time.

00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:21.533
There are going to be bumps
on the road to recovery.

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.033
We know that.

00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:26.867
But we also know what's happened
here, at this Chrysler plant.

00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:29.834
We know that hardworking
Americans like Jill helped turn

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:33.033
this company and
this industry around.

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:35.133
That's the American story.

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:37.100
We're a people who
don't give up --

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.633
who do big things, who
shape our own destiny.

00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:43.133
And I'm absolutely confident
that if we hold on to that

00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:47.066
spirit, our best days
are still ahead of us.

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:49.300
Thanks for tuning in,
and have a great weekend.
