00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.734
The President:
This week, we've made important progress towards the goal of

00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:11.066
bringing about change
abroad and change at home.

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.834
During my visit to Russia, we
began the process of resetting

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:17.633
relations so that we can address
key national priorities like the

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:20.867
threat of nuclear
weapons and extremism.

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:24.934
At the G8 summit, leaders from
nearly 30 nations met to discuss

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:27.633
how we'll collectively confront the urgent challenges of our

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:31.066
time, from managing the global recession to fighting global

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:34.500
warming to addressing
global hunger and poverty.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.233
And in Ghana, I laid out my
agenda for supporting democracy

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:41.834
and development in Africa
and around the world.

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:44.767
But even as we make progress
on these challenges abroad,

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:47.700
my thoughts are on the state
of our economy at home.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.300
And that's what I want to
talk to you about today.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.533
We came into office facing the
most severe economic downturn

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.367
since the Great Depression.

00:00:55.367 --> 00:01:00.367
At the time, we were losing, on
average 700,000 jobs a month.

00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:02.800
And many feared that our
financial system was on the

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.900
verge of collapse.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.433
As a result of the swift and
aggressive action we took in the

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:10.000
first few months of this year,
we've been able to pull our

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.834
financial system and our
economy back from the brink.

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:16.066
We took steps to re-start
lending to families and

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:19.567
businesses, stabilize our
major financial institutions,

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:23.433
and help homeowners stay in
their homes and pay their mortgages.

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:26.800
We also passed the largest and
most sweeping economic recovery

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.433
plan in our nation's history.

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:31.967
The Recovery Act wasn't designed
to restore the economy to full

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:35.367
health on its own, but to
provide the boost necessary to

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:37.233
stop the free fall.

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:40.367
It was designed to spur demand
and get people spending again

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.367
and cushion those who had
borne the brunt of the crisis.

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:46.900
And it was designed to save
jobs and create new ones.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.700
In a little over 100 days, this Recovery Act has worked as intended.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.500
It's already extended unemployment insurance and

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.500
health insurance to those who
have lost their jobs in this recession.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.433
It's delivered $43 billion in tax relief to American working

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:03.567
families and businesses.

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:05.934
Without the help the Recovery
Act has provided to struggling

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:09.934
states, its estimated that state
deficits would be nearly twice

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:13.500
as large as they are now,
resulting in tens of thousands

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.433
of additional layoffs --
layoffs that would affect police

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:20.533
officers, teachers,
and firefighters.

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:23.200
The Recovery Act's allowed small businesses and clean energy

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.433
companies to hire new workers
or scrap their plans for

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:28.467
eliminating current jobs.

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:30.934
And it's led to new
jobs building roads,

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:33.500
bridges and other
infrastructure projects,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.066
thousands of which are
only beginning now.

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:40.233
In the months to come, thousands
more projects will begin,

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:42.200
leading to additional jobs.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.600
Now, I realize that when we
passed this Recovery Act,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.233
there were those who felt that
doing nothing was somehow an answer.

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:50.500
Today, some of those same
critics are already judging the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.934
effort a failure although they
haven't yet offered a plausible alternative.

00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:57.000
Others believed that the
recovery plan should have been

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.533
even larger, and they're already
calling for a second recovery plan.

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:04.000
But, as I made clear at
the time it was passed,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.867
the Recovery Act was not
designed to work in four months

00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:10.567
-- it was designed to
work over two years.

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:12.800
We also knew that it would take
some time for the money to get

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.900
out the door, because we're
committed to spending it in a

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.000
way that's effective
and transparent.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.266
Crucially, this is a plan that
will also accelerate greatly

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:24.467
through the summer and the fall.

00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:27.100
We must let it work the
way it's supposed to,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.567
with the understanding
that in any recession,

00:03:29.567 --> 00:03:32.667
unemployment tends to recover
more slowly than other measures

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:35.133
of economic activity.

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:37.734
Now, I'm confident that the United States of America will

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:39.900
weather this economic storm.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.033
But once we clear
away the wreckage,

00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:45.934
the real question is what
we will build in its place.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:49.300
Even as we rescue this economy
from a full blown crisis,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.200
I've insisted that we must
rebuild it better than before.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.533
Without serious reforms, we're
destined to either see more

00:03:55.533 --> 00:03:58.767
crises, or suffer stagnant
growth rates for the foreseeable

00:03:58.767 --> 00:04:01.800
future, or a
combination of the two.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.100
That's a future I
absolutely reject.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.500
And that's why we're laying a
new foundation that's not only

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.000
strong enough to withstand the
challenges of the 21st century,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.367
but one that will allow us to
thrive and compete in a global economy.

00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:16.767
That means investing in
the jobs of the future,

00:04:16.767 --> 00:04:19.266
training our workers to
compete for those jobs,

00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:23.867
and controlling the health care
costs that are driving us into debt.

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:26.066
Through the clean energy
investment we've made in the

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:28.633
Recovery Act, we're already
seeing start-ups and small

00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:32.467
businesses make plans to
create thousands of new jobs.

00:04:32.467 --> 00:04:36.667
In California, 3,000 people will
be employed to build a new solar plant.

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:40.066
In Michigan, investments in wind
turbines and wind technology is

00:04:40.066 --> 00:04:43.333
expected to create
over 2,600 jobs.

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:45.834
And a few weeks ago, the House
of Representatives passed

00:04:45.834 --> 00:04:49.734
historic legislation that would
finally make clean energy the

00:04:49.734 --> 00:04:53.500
profitable kind of energy,
leading to whole new industries

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.133
and jobs that can't
be outsourced.

00:04:56.133 --> 00:04:58.233
To give our workers the skills
and education they need to

00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:01.667
compete for the high-tech,
high-wage jobs of the future,

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:04.700
we're working on reforms that
will close achievement gaps,

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.333
ensure that our schools
meet high standards,

00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:10.200
reward our teachers for
performance and give them new

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.233
pathways to advancement.

00:05:12.233 --> 00:05:14.734
Finally, we've made important
progress in the last few weeks

00:05:14.734 --> 00:05:17.734
on health care reform that
will control the costs that are

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.567
driving our families,
our businesses,

00:05:19.567 --> 00:05:22.066
and our government into debt.

00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:24.367
Both the Senate and the House
have now produced legislation

00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:26.633
that will bring down costs,
provide better care for

00:05:26.633 --> 00:05:29.467
patients, and curb the worst
practices of insurance

00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:33.266
companies, so that they can no
longer deny Americans coverage

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:35.934
based on a pre-existing
medical condition.

00:05:35.934 --> 00:05:38.166
It's a plan that would also
allow Americans to keep their

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:42.600
health insurance if they lose
their job or if they change their job.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.567
And it would set up a health
insurance exchange --

00:05:45.567 --> 00:05:48.800
a marketplace that will allow
families and small businesses to

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.934
access one-stop-shopping for
quality, affordable coverage,

00:05:52.934 --> 00:05:57.800
and help them compare prices and
choose the plan that best suits their needs.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.834
One such choice would be a
public option that would make

00:06:00.834 --> 00:06:04.100
health care more affordable
through competition that keeps

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.133
the insurance companies honest.

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:07.500
One other point.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.633
Part of what makes our
current economic situation so

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:13.800
challenging is that we already
had massive deficits as the

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.900
recession gathered force.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.500
And although the Recovery Act
represents just a small fraction

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.734
of our long term debt, people
have legitimate questions as to

00:06:21.734 --> 00:06:26.667
whether we can afford reform
without making our deficits much worse.

00:06:26.667 --> 00:06:30.633
So let me be clear; I have been
firm in insisting that both

00:06:30.633 --> 00:06:34.700
health care reform and clean
energy legislation cannot add to

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.166
our deficit.

00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:38.734
And I intend to continue
the work of reducing waste,

00:06:38.734 --> 00:06:40.800
eliminating programs
that don't work,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.266
and reforming our entitlement
programs to ensure that our long

00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:47.867
term deficits are
brought under control.

00:06:47.867 --> 00:06:50.800
I said when I took office that
it would take many months to

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.000
move our economy from recession
to recovery and ultimately to prosperity.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.900
We're not there yet, and I
continue to believe that even

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.233
one American out of
work is one too many.

00:07:02.233 --> 00:07:04.233
But we're moving in
the right direction.

00:07:04.233 --> 00:07:06.900
We're cleaning up the
wreckage of this storm.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.233
And we are laying a firmer,
stronger foundation so that we

00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:14.066
may better weather whatever
future storms may come.

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:17.066
This year has been and will
continue to be a year of

00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:20.333
rescuing our economy
from disaster.

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:23.000
But just as important will be
the work of rebuilding a long

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.600
term engine for economic growth.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.834
It won't be easy, and there will
continue to be those who argue

00:07:28.834 --> 00:07:31.633
that we have to put off hard
decisions that we have already

00:07:31.633 --> 00:07:34.000
deferred for far too long.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.266
But earlier generations of
Americans didn't build this

00:07:36.266 --> 00:07:41.133
great country by fearing the
future and shrinking our dreams.

00:07:41.133 --> 00:07:43.934
This generation --
our generation --

00:07:43.934 --> 00:07:47.834
has to show that same
courage and determination.

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:49.500
I believe we will.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.700
Thanks for listening.
