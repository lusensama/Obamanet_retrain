00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.467
The President:
Over the past couple weeks I've
been talking with folks across

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:11.367
the country about how we're
going to rebuild an economy

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:14.900
where if you work hard, you
and your family can get ahead.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.567
And right now, there's a big
debate going on in Washington

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:21.100
over two fundamentally different
paths we can take as a country

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.300
to do that.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.000
One path -- pushed by
Republicans in Congress and

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.934
their nominee for President --
says that the best way to create

00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:31.133
prosperity is to let it
trickle down from the top.

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.700
They believe that if we spend
trillions more on tax cuts for

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.700
the wealthy, it'll
somehow create jobs --

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.166
even if we have to pay for it by
gutting education and training

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.967
and by raising
middle-class taxes.

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:44.667
I think they're wrong.

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:47.367
We already tried it that way
for most of the last decade,

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:49.166
and it didn't work.

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.867
We're still paying for trillions
of dollars in tax cuts that

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:54.800
benefited the wealthiest
Americans more than anyone else;

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.233
tax cuts that didn't lead to the
rise in wages and middle class

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:01.333
jobs that we were promised; and
that helped take us from record

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:04.266
surpluses to record deficits.

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:08.300
The last thing we need right
now is more top-down economics.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.900
What we need are policies that
will grow and strengthen the

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.667
middle class; that
will help create jobs,

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:15.467
make education and
training more affordable,

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:19.166
and encourage businesses to
start up and stay right here in

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.900
the United States.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.734
Soon, we'll face a
choice between these two

00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:24.266
different approaches.

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:28.166
On January 1st, taxes are set
to go up for tens of millions

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.533
of Americans.

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.600
I think that would be a
huge financial hit for

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.800
middle-class families.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.000
That's why I've cut middle-class
taxes every year that I've been

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.734
President -- by $3,600
for the typical family.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.467
And that's why, this week,
I called on Congress to

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:47.333
immediately stop the January
1st tax hike from hitting any

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:52.033
American on the first
$250,000 of their income.

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:55.433
Under my plan, 98% of American
families won't see their income

00:01:55.433 --> 00:01:57.567
taxes go up at all.

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:00.333
But the other 2% of Americans
will have to pay a little more

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:04.867
on taxes on anything
they make over $250,000.

00:02:04.867 --> 00:02:07.400
In other words, the wealthiest
few Americans will go back to

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.300
the income tax rates they were
paying under Bill Clinton.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.066
And if you remember, that was
when our economy created nearly

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:17.734
23 million new jobs, the biggest
budget surplus in history,

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:21.066
and millionaires were
doing pretty well to boot.

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:24.133
The folks in Congress and on the
campaign trail who oppose this

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:27.033
plan warn that it would somehow
hurt small businesses and

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:28.567
job creators.

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:32.200
Well, they're completely
ignoring the facts.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.767
Under my plan, 97% of small
business owners would avoid

00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:39.333
getting hit with any
income tax hike whatsoever.

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:42.300
In fact, I've cut taxes for
small businesses eighteen times

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.000
since I've been President.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.467
And just this week, I ordered a
series of new steps to help our

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:50.533
small businesses grow and hire.

00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:53.300
So the only place Republicans
and I disagree is whether we

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.233
keep giving tax cuts to the
wealthiest 2% of Americans.

00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:00.734
Republicans in Washington
want more of those tax cuts.

00:03:00.734 --> 00:03:04.066
With the deficit we have, I
don't think we can afford them.

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:06.567
But even if we disagree on the
tax cuts for the wealthiest

00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:10.066
Americans, we all agree that no
American should pay more taxes

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:13.300
on the first $250,000
of their income.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.333
So let's at least agree to
do what we all agree on.

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:19.500
That's what compromise
is all about.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.233
Let's not hold the vast majority
of Americans and our entire

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:25.934
economy hostage while we debate
the merits of another tax cut

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:27.367
for the wealthy.

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:29.967
Let's skip the
unnecessary drama,

00:03:29.967 --> 00:03:33.500
the needless delays and all the
partisan posturing and let's

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.467
just do the right thing
for the people who sent us

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:37.000
here to serve.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.233
And I'm going to keep fighting
to make sure we rebuild an

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:42.667
economy that rewards work,
grows the middle class,

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:45.967
and gives new opportunity to
those trying to earn their way

00:03:45.967 --> 00:03:48.266
into the middle class.

00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:50.033
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
