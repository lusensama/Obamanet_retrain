00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:11.211
The President: Hi everybody.

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.913
It's now been a year since
the tragic death of Michael

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:16.216
Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:19.285
His death-along with the
events in Cleveland, Staten

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.921
Island, Baltimore,
Cincinnati, and other

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.991
communities-sparked protests
and soul searching all

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:26.493
across our country.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.661
Over the past year, we've
come to see, more clearly

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.931
than ever, the frustration
in many communities of color

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.533
and the feeling that
our laws can be

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.469
applied unevenly.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.239
After Ferguson, I said that
we had to face these

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.007
issues squarely.

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.076
I convened a task force on
community policing to find

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:46.746
commonsense steps that can
help us drive down crime and

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.681
build up trust and
cooperation between

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:52.485
communities and police, who
put their lives on the line

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:55.388
every single day to
help keep us safe.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.891
And I've met personally with
rank and file officers to

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.359
hear their ideas.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.997
In May, this task force
made up of police officers,

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:09.035
activists and academics
proposed 59 recommendations

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:12.105
- everything from how we can
make better use of data and

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:15.675
technology, to how we train
police officers, to how law

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:18.011
enforcement engages
with our schools.

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.180
And we've been working with
communities across America

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.215
to put these
ideas into action.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:25.118
Dozens of police departments
are now sharing more data

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:28.221
with the public, including
on citations, stops and

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:31.858
searches, and shootings
involving law enforcement.

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:33.626
We've brought together
leaders from across the

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:37.030
country to explore
alternatives to incarceration.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.666
The Justice Department has
begun pilot programs to help

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.402
police use body cameras and
collect data on the

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.870
use of force.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.806
This fall, the department
will award more than $160

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:49.175
million in grants to
support law enforcement and

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.277
community organizations
that are working to

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.546
improve policing.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:56.416
And all across the country
- from states like Illinois

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:59.118
and Ohio, to cities like
Philadelphia, Boston, and

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:02.622
Nashville - local leaders
are working to implement the

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:05.091
task force recommendations
in a way that works for

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.893
their communities.

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:08.695
So we've made progress.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.096
And we'll keep at it.

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:12.999
But let's be clear: the
issues raised over the past

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.335
year aren't new, and they
won't be solved by

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:17.136
policing alone.

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:19.806
We simply can't ask our
police to contain and

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.675
control issues that the rest
of us aren't willing to

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.811
address-as a society.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.447
That starts with reforming a
criminal justice system that

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:30.450
too often is a pipeline
from inadequate schools to

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.152
overcrowded jails, wreaking
havoc on communities and

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:35.121
families all
across the country.

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.223
So we need Congress
to reform our federal

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:40.293
sentencing laws for
non-violent drug offenders.

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:43.229
We need to keep working to
help more prisoners take

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.532
steps to turn their
lives around so they can

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.367
contribute to their
communities after they've

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.068
served their time.

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:52.238
More broadly, we need to
truly invest in our children

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:55.408
and our communities so that
more young people see a

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:57.777
better path for their lives.

00:02:57.777 --> 00:02:59.746
That means investing in
early childhood education,

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:02.749
job training,
pathways to college.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.785
It means dealing honestly
with issues of race,

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:08.488
poverty, and class that
leave too many communities

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.423
feeling isolated and
segregated from

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:11.991
greater opportunity.

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:14.961
It means expanding that
opportunity to every

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:17.597
American willing to work for
it, no matter what zip code

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:19.365
they were born into.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.467
Because, in the end, that's
always been the

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:23.403
promise of America.

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.605
And that's what I'll keep
working for every single day

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.173
that I'm President.

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:29.742
Thanks everybody, and
have a great weekend.
