00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.800
The President:
Right now, there are a lot of
folks who are still struggling

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.066
with the effects
of the recession.

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.667
They're wondering how they'd
deal with an unexpected expense

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:14.667
if their car breaks down.

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:16.467
They're worried about layoffs.

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:19.600
They're not sure if they can
help their kids pay for college.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.200
And for many families, these
challenges were around long

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.100
before the recession
hit in 2007.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.700
I ran for President because I
believed in an America where

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.233
ordinary folks
could get ahead --

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:33.433
where if you worked hard,
you could have a better life.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.800
That's been my focus
since I came into office,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.233
and that has to
be our focus now.

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:40.300
It's one of the reasons why
we're working to reduce our

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.133
nation's deficit.

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.300
Government has to start
living within its means,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.000
just like families do.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.967
We have to cut the spending we
can't afford so we can put the

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:52.133
economy on a sounder footing
and give our businesses the

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:55.900
confidence they need to
grow and create jobs.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.867
The good news is, Democrats and
Republicans agree on the need to

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:02.834
solve the problem, and
over the last few weeks,

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:05.800
the Vice President and I have
gotten both parties to identify

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.700
more than $1 trillion
in spending cuts --

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.867
that's trillion with a T.

00:01:10.867 --> 00:01:13.400
But after a decade in which
Washington ran up the country's

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.000
credit card, we've got to
find more savings to get out

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.433
of the red.

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:21.467
That means looking at every
program and tax break in the

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:25.934
budget -- every single one --
to find places to cut waste and

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:27.533
save money.

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:30.467
It means we'll have to start
making some tough decisions and

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:33.000
scale back worthy programs.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And nothing can be off-limits,
including spending in the tax

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.600
code -- particularly the
loopholes that benefit very few

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.400
individuals and corporations.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.967
Now, it would be nice if we
could keep every tax break --

00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:47.834
but we can't afford them.

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:50.166
Because if we choose to
keep those tax breaks for

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:53.967
millionaires and billionaires,
or for hedge fund managers and

00:01:53.967 --> 00:01:57.266
corporate jet owners, or for oil
and gas companies pulling in

00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:00.967
huge profits without our help,
then we'll have to make even

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:03.467
deeper cuts somewhere else.

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:05.367
We've got to say to a
student, you don't get a

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:07.166
college scholarship.

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:08.967
We have to say to a
medical researcher,

00:02:08.967 --> 00:02:11.567
you can't do that
cancer research.

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:14.500
We might have to tell seniors,
you have to pay more for

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.734
your Medicare.

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:18.467
That isn't right
and it isn't smart.

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:21.567
We've got to cut the deficit,
but we can do that while making

00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:24.667
investments in education and
research and technology that

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:26.800
actually create jobs.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.000
We can live within our means
while still investing in

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.667
our future.

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:32.233
That's what we have to do.

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:35.533
And I'm confident that Democrats
and Republicans in Congress can

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:39.667
find a way to give some ground,
make some tough choices,

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:42.233
and put their shoulders to the
wheel to get this done for the

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:44.433
sake of the country.

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:47.100
On Monday, we celebrate
Independence Day --

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.400
the day we declared a new nation
based on a revolutionary idea

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.033
that people ought to
determine their own destiny;

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:58.100
that freedom and self-governance
weren't gifts handed to us by

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.800
kings or emperors, but the
rights of every human being.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.734
We've learned in the years since
that democracy isn't always

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:09.667
pretty -- we have
arguments, we disagree.

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.333
But time and again, we've proven
that we could come together to

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:14.200
solve problems.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.800
We remember that while we
may not see eye to eye on

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.400
everything, we share a love
for this country and a faith in

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.066
its future.

00:03:22.066 --> 00:03:24.667
That's the spirit we
need to harness now.

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:26.433
That's how we'll
meet this challenge,

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:29.200
and that's how we'll
reach a brighter day.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.800
Thanks for listening, and have
a wonderful Fourth of July.
