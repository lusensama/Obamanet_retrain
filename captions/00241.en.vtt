00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:06.633
President Obama:
Hi.

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:10.066
I'm speaking with you today from
the Allison Transmission plant

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.333
at Indianapolis, Indiana.

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:15.266
I came here because this is a
place where American workers are

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.100
doing some big and
impressive things.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.834
The hybrid technology they
manufacture here already powers

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:24.500
nearly 4,000 buses
all over the world --

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.734
buses that have already saved
15 million gallons of fuel.

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:32.467
Soon, they'll expand this new
technology to trucks as well.

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:36.667
That means more vehicles using
less oil, and that means jobs --

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:40.633
more than 200 new workers
at this plant alone.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:44.367
That's important because even as
the economy is growing after one

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:46.633
of the worst recessions
in our history;

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:49.500
even as we've added more than
two million new private sector

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.266
jobs over the past 14 months;
I still meet and hear from

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.533
Americans struggling
to get out of their own

00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.400
personal recessions.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.667
A lot of folks out there
are still looking for work.

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:03.633
And many folks who do have jobs
are finding that their paychecks

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:05.800
aren't keeping up with the
rising costs of everything from

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.166
tuition to groceries
to gas prices.

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.467
In fact, in a lot of
places across the country,

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:15.934
like here in Indiana, gas
has reached an all-time high.

00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:18.633
So although our economy hasn't
been the focus of the news this

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:23.567
week, not a day goes by that
I'm not focused on your jobs,

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:26.066
your hopes, and your dreams.

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.700
And that's why I came here
to Allison Transmissions.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.934
The clean energy jobs at this
plant are the jobs of the future

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:35.433
-- jobs that pay well
right here in America.

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:38.200
And in the years ahead, it's
clean energy companies like this

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.567
one that will keep our economy
growing, create new jobs,

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.834
and make sure America remains
the most prosperous nation

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:46.734
in the world.

00:01:46.734 --> 00:01:49.800
Allison Transmissions is also
part of the ultimate solution to

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.633
high gas prices.

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:54.333
We know there are no quick
fixes to this problem.

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:57.900
In the short term, we're doing
everything we can to boost safe

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.133
and responsible oil
production here at home --

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:03.967
in fact, last year, American oil
production reached its highest

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:06.667
level since 2003.

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:10.400
But over the long term, the only
way we can avoid being held

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.633
hostage to the ups and downs of
oil prices is if we reduce our

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.667
dependence on oil.

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:19.934
That means investing in clean,
alternative sources of energy,

00:02:19.934 --> 00:02:22.934
like advanced biofuels
and natural gas.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:25.934
And that means making cars
and trucks and buses that

00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:27.767
use less oil.

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:31.166
Other countries know this, and
they're going all in to invest

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:35.033
in clean energy technologies
and clean energy jobs.

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:37.533
I don't want other countries to
win the competition for these

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:40.033
technologies and these jobs.

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:42.266
I want America to
win that competition.

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:44.500
I want America to
win the future.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.567
Now, I know that in a tough
fiscal climate like the one

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:49.600
we're in, it's tempting for
some to try and cut back on our

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.734
investments in clean energy.

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:54.567
And I absolutely agree that the
only way we'll be able to afford

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:58.367
the things we need is by cutting
the things we don't and living

00:02:58.367 --> 00:03:00.200
within our means.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.000
But I refuse to cut investments
like clean energy that will help

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.367
us out-innovate and out-compete
the rest of the world.

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:09.300
I refuse to cut investments
that are making it possible for

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.500
plants like this one to grow
and add jobs across America.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.433
We can do this.

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:17.667
I don't just believe that
because I see it happening in

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:19.400
plants like this.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.734
I believe that because I believe
in the Americans that are making

00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:25.300
it happen in places like this.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.367
I'm optimistic about
our economic future,

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:29.367
because for all the
challenges we face,

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:32.066
America is still home to
the most entrepreneurial,

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:36.266
most industrious, most
determined people on Earth.

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:38.233
There's nothing we can't
accomplish when we set our

00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:39.600
minds to it.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.333
And that's what we'll keep doing
as long as I have the privilege

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:44.166
of being your President.

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:46.066
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
