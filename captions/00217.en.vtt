00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:09.066
The President:
This week, a new economic report
confirmed what most Americans

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:13.033
already believe to be true:
over the past three decades,

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:16.066
the middle class has lost ground
while the wealthiest few have

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.934
become even wealthier.

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.967
In fact, the average income for
the top 1% of Americans has

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:24.967
risen almost seven times faster
than the income of the average

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:26.867
middle class family.

00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:28.767
And this has happened during
a period where the cost of

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:32.900
everything from health care
to college has skyrocketed.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.233
Now, in this country, we don't
begrudge anyone wealth or

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:38.200
success -- we encourage it.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.934
We celebrate it.

00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:43.333
But America is better off when
everyone had the chance to get

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:47.533
ahead -- not just those at the
very top of the income scale.

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:52.467
The more Americans who prosper,
the more America prospers.

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:54.867
Rebuilding an economy where
everyone has the chance to

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:57.633
succeed will take time.

00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.834
Our economic problems were
decades in the making,

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:02.000
and they won't be
solved overnight.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.934
But there are steps we can take
right now to put people back to

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:08.266
work and restore some of the
security that middle-class

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:11.333
Americans have lost over
the last few decades.

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.300
Right now, Congress can pass
a set of common-sense jobs

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.166
proposals that independent
economists tell us will boost

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.333
the economy right away.

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.667
Proposals that will put
more teachers, veterans,

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:25.500
construction workers and first
responders back on the job.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.100
Proposals that will cut taxes
for virtually every middle class

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.734
family and small
business in America.

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:33.233
These are the same kinds of
proposals that both Democrats

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:35.967
and Republicans have
supported in the past.

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:40.300
And they should stop playing
politics and act on them now.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.433
These jobs proposals are also
paid for by asking folks who are

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:46.033
making more than a million
dollars a year to contribute a

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:48.066
little more in taxes.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.900
These are the same folks who
have seen their incomes go up so

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.333
much, and I believe this
is a contribution they're

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.200
willing to make.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.767
One survey found that nearly 7
in 10 millionaires are willing

00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:03.533
to step up and pay a little more
in order to help the economy.

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:05.800
Unfortunately, Republicans
in Congress aren't

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.200
paying attention.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.867
They haven't gotten the message.

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:11.934
Over and over, they have refused
to even debate the same kinds of

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:15.800
jobs proposals that Republicans
have supported in the past --

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.166
proposals that
today are supported,

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:20.000
not just by Democrats, but
by Independent and Republican

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.500
voters all across America.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.367
Somehow, though, they found time
this week to debate things like

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:28.266
whether or not we should mint
coins to celebrate the Baseball

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:29.934
Hall of Fame.

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:31.967
And meanwhile, they're only
scheduled to work three more

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:35.567
weeks between now and
the end of the year.

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:39.867
The truth is, we can no longer
wait for Congress to do its job.

00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:42.433
The middle-class families who
have been struggling for years

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:44.300
are tired of waiting.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.000
They need help now.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.166
So where Congress
won't act, I will.

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:51.767
This week, we announced a new
policy that will help families

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:55.166
whose home values have fallen to
refinance their mortgages and

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:57.266
save thousands of dollars.

00:02:57.266 --> 00:02:59.266
We're making it easier for
veterans to get jobs putting

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.266
their skills to work in
hospitals and community

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:02.734
health centers.

00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:05.900
We reformed the student loan
process so more young people can

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.000
get out of debt faster.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And we're going to keep
announcing more changes like

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.200
these on a regular basis.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.333
These steps will
make a difference.

00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:16.500
But they won't take the place
of the bold action we need from

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.233
Congress to get this
economy moving again.

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:22.133
And that's why I need all of
you to make your voices heard.

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:24.834
Tell Congress to stop playing
politics and start taking

00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:27.000
action on jobs.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.266
If we want to rebuild an economy
where every American has the

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:32.266
chance to get ahead, then we're
going to need every American to

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:33.934
get involved.

00:03:33.934 --> 00:03:36.200
That's how real change
has always happened,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.400
and that's how
it'll happen today.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.500
Thanks.
