00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.300
Yesterday, we learned that the economy

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.100
lost another 651,000 jobs in the month of 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.100
February, which brings the total number of jobs

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.200
lost in this recession to 4.4 million.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.500
The unemployment rate has now surpassed 8 percent,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.000
the highest rate in a quarter century.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.100
These aren't just statistics, but hardships

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.000
experienced personally by millions of Americans

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.100
who no longer know how they'll pay their bills,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.500
or make their mortgage, or raise their families.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.100
From the day I took office, I knew that solving this

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.000
crisis would not be easy, nor would it happen overnight.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.000
And we will continue to face difficult

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.000
days in the months ahead. But I also believe that

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.100
we will get through this -- that if we act swiftly

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.100
and boldly and responsibly, the United States

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.000
of America will emerge stronger

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.300
and more prosperous than it was before.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.000
That's why my administration is committed

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.000
to doing all that's necessary to address this crisis

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.000
and lead us to a better day. That's why we're moving

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.500
forward with an economic agenda that will jumpstart

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.000
job creation, restart lending, relieve responsible 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.000
homeowners, and address the long-term economic

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.000
challenges of our time:  the cost of health care,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.100
our dependence on oil, and the state of our schools.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.000
To prevent foreclosures for as many as 4 million

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.700
homeowners -- and lower interest rates and lift

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.100
home values for millions more -- we are implementing

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.100
a plan to allow lenders to work with borrowers

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.100
to refinance or restructure their mortgages.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.100
On Wednesday, the Department of Treasury and Housing

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.100
and Urban Development released the guidelines that

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.400
lenders will use for lowering mortgage payments.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.500
This plan is now at work.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.100
To restore the availability of affordable loans

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.100
for families and businesses -- not just banks

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.100
-- we are taking steps to restart the flow of credit

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.700
and stabilize the financial markets.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.400
On Thursday, the Treasury Department and the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.700
Federal Reserve launched the Consumer and Business

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.100
Lending Initiative -- a plan that will generate up to

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200
a trillion dollars of new lending so that families

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.100
can finance a car or college education -- and small

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.400
businesses can raise the capital that will create jobs.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.100
And we've already begun to implement the American

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.100
Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- a plan that will

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.200
save and create over 3.5 million jobs over the next

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.000
two years -- jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.900
constructing wind turbines and solar panels,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
expanding broadband and mass transit. And because

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.100
of this plan, those who have lost their job in this

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.000
recession will be able to receive extended unemployment

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.100
benefits and continued health care coverage, while 95

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.000
percent of working Americans will receive

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.000
a tax break beginning April 1st.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.000
Of course, like every family going through hard times,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.300
our country must make tough choices.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
In order to pay for the things we need --

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.000
we cannot waste money on the things we don't.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.000
My administration inherited a $1.3 trillion budget deficit

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.000
the largest in history. And we've inherited a budgeting

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.800
process as irresponsible as it is unsustainable.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
For years, as Wall Street used accounting tricks to conceal

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.000
costs and avoid responsibility, Washington did, too.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.200
These kinds of irresponsible budgets --

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.500
and inexcusable practices --

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.000
are now in the past. For the first time in many years

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.100
my administration has produced a budget that represents an

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.400
honest reckoning of where we are and where we need to go.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.500
It's also a budget that begins to make the hard choices

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.500
that we've avoided for far too long --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
a strategy that cuts where we must and invests where we need.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.200
That's why it includes $2 trillion in deficit reduction

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.000
while making historic investments in America's future.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.400
That's why it reduces discretionary spending for non-defense

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.000
programs as a share of the economy by more than 10 percent

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.000
over the next decade -- to the lowest level since they began

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.000
keeping these records nearly half a century ago.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.000
And that's why on Wednesday, I signed a presidential

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.000
memorandum to end unnecessary no-bid contracts

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.200
and dramatically reform the way contracts are awarded --

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.000
reforms that will save the American people

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.300
up to $40 billion each year.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.400
Finally, because we cannot bring our deficit down

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.000
or grow our economy without tackling the skyrocketing

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.000
cost of health care, I held a health care summit

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.200
on Thursday to begin the long-overdue process of reform.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.000
Our ideas and opinions about how to achieve this reform

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.000
will vary, but our goal must be the same: quality, affordable 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.000
health care for every American that no longer overwhelms the

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.200
budgets of families, businesses, and our government.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.500
Yes, this is a moment of challenge for our country.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But we've experienced great trials before.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.000
And with every test, each generation has found

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.000
the capacity to not only endure, but to prosper --

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.000
to discover great opportunity in the midst of great crisis.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.000
That is what we can and must do today.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.000
And I am absolutely confident that is what we will do.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.000
I'm confident that at this defining moment

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.500
we will prove ourselves worthy of the sacrifice

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.200
of those who came before us

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.500
and the promise of those who will come after.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.800
Thank you.
