00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.133
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:10.333
As a nation, our top priority is
growing our economy and creating

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.266
good middle class jobs.

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.600
That's why this week I'm
speaking to you from the Argonne

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.667
National Laboratory in Illinois,
because few areas hold as much

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:21.700
promise as what they're
focused on right here --

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.233
harnessing American energy.

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.633
You see, after years
of talking about it,

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:31.000
we're finally poised to take
control of our energy future.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.567
We produce more oil than
we have in 15 years.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:38.100
We import less oil than
we have in 20 years.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.800
We've doubled the amount of
renewable energy we generate

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.800
from sources like
wind and solar --

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.867
with tens of thousands of
good jobs to show for it.

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:48.800
We're producing more natural
gas than ever before --

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.033
with hundreds of thousands
of good jobs to show for it.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:54.767
We've supported the first new
nuclear power plant since

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:56.100
the 1970s.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.567
And we're sending less carbon
pollution into the environment

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:02.367
than we have in nearly 20 years.

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:04.500
So we're making real progress.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.834
But over the past few weeks,
we got a reminder that we have

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.400
more work to do.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.767
We went through another spike in
gas prices, just like last year,

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:14.300
and the year before that.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.066
It happens every year.

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.333
It's a serious blow
to your budget --

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:21.533
like getting hit with a new tax
coming right out of your pocket.

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:24.000
Over the past four years, as
part of our all-of-the-above

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
energy strategy, we've taken
steps to soften that blow by

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.200
making sure our
cars use less gas.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.867
We've put in place the toughest
fuel economy standards in our

00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:35.367
history so that by the
middle of the next decade,

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:38.834
our cars will go twice as
far on a gallon of gas.

00:01:38.834 --> 00:01:41.700
Over the life of a new car, the
average family will save more

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.200
than $8,000 at the pump.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.967
But the only way we're going to
break this cycle of spiking gas

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:51.100
prices for good is to shift
our cars and trucks off of

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.600
oil for good.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.333
That's why, in my State
of the Union Address,

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:58.867
I called on Congress to set up
an Energy Security Trust to fund

00:01:58.867 --> 00:02:01.567
research into new technologies
that will help us

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:03.200
reach that goal.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.867
Here's how it would work.

00:02:04.867 --> 00:02:07.367
Much of our energy is drawn
from lands and waters that we,

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:09.200
the public, own together.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.000
So I'm proposing that we take
some of our oil and gas revenues

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.433
from public lands and put it
towards research that will

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:18.900
benefit the public, so that we
can support American ingenuity

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.333
without adding a
dime to our deficit.

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.734
We can support scientists who
are designing new engines that

00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:26.800
are more energy efficient;
developing cheaper batteries

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.033
that go farther on
a single charge;

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:32.066
and devising new ways to fuel
our cars and trucks with new

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:35.600
sources of clean energy -- like
advanced biofuels and natural

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.700
gas -- so drivers can one day go
coast-to-coast without using a

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.433
drop of oil.

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:43.867
Now, this idea isn't mine.

00:02:43.867 --> 00:02:46.400
It actually builds off a
proposal put forward by a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.367
non-partisan coalition of
CEOs and retired generals

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:51.533
and admirals.

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:54.300
So let's take their advice
and free our families and our

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.667
businesses from painful spikes
in gas prices once and for all.

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:01.100
And in the meantime, let's
keep moving forward on an

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.433
all-of-the-above
energy strategy.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:06.500
A strategy where we produce
more oil and gas here at home,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.400
but also more biofuels and
fuel-efficient vehicles;

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.734
more solar power and wind power.

00:03:11.734 --> 00:03:15.367
A strategy where we put more
people to work building cars,

00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:18.700
homes and businesses
that waste less energy.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.000
We can do this.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We're Americans.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.633
And when we commit
ourselves to something,

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:25.667
there's no telling
how far we'll go.

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:27.567
Thanks and have a great weekend.
