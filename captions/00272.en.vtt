00:00:08.628 --> 00:00:12.994
The President:
Today, we pause to remember a day that tested our country.

00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:17.828
On September 11, 2001, nearly 3,000 lives were lost in the

00:00:17.828 --> 00:00:22.227
deadliest attack on American soil in our history.

00:00:22.227 --> 00:00:25.061
We will never forget the images
of planes vanishing into

00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:29.795
buildings; of photos hung by
the families of the missing.

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:33.594
We will never forget the anger and the sadness that we felt.

00:00:33.594 --> 00:00:35.895
And while nine years have come
and gone since that September

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:40.261
morning, the passage of time
will never diminish the pain and

00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:44.795
loss forever seared in the
consciousness of our nation.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:50.494
That's why, on this day, we
pray with the families of those who died.

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:54.594
We mourn with the husbands and
wives, the children and parents,

00:00:54.594 --> 00:00:57.361
friends and loved ones.

00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:59.528
We think about the milestones
that have passed over the course

00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:03.094
of nine years -- births and christenings,

00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:08.194
weddings and graduations -- all with an empty chair.

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:11.928
On this day, we also honor those
who died so that others might

00:01:11.928 --> 00:01:15.528
live: the firefighters and first
responders who climbed the

00:01:15.528 --> 00:01:19.361
stairs of two burning towers;
the passengers who stormed a

00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:23.494
cockpit; and the men and women
who have, in the years since,

00:01:23.494 --> 00:01:26.428
borne the uniform of this
country and given their lives so

00:01:26.428 --> 00:01:30.394
that our children could
grow up in a safer world.

00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:35.861
In acts of courage and decency,
they defended a simple precept:

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:40.494
I am my brother's keeper;
I am my sister's keeper.

00:01:40.494 --> 00:01:44.227
And on this day, we recall
that at our darkest moment,

00:01:44.227 --> 00:01:48.127
we summoned a sense of
unity and common purpose.

00:01:48.127 --> 00:01:51.361
We responded to the worst kind
of depravity with the best of

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:53.561
our humanity.

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:56.994
So, each year at this time, we
renew our resolve against those

00:01:56.994 --> 00:02:00.361
who perpetrated this barbaric
act of terror and who continue

00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:03.828
to plot against us -- for we will never waver in defense of

00:02:03.828 --> 00:02:05.528
this nation.

00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:07.961
We renew our commitment to our
troops and all who serve to

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.661
protect this country,
and to their families.

00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:15.027
But we also renew the
true spirit of that day.

00:02:15.027 --> 00:02:19.928
Not the human capacity for evil,
but the human capacity for good.

00:02:19.928 --> 00:02:25.094
Not the desire to destroy,
but the impulse to save.

00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:27.994
That's why we mark September
11th as a National Day of

00:02:27.994 --> 00:02:30.528
Service and Remembrance.

00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:32.895
For if there is a lesson to
be drawn on this anniversary,

00:02:32.895 --> 00:02:37.461
it is this: we are one nation -- one people --

00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:41.594
bound not only by grief, but
by a set of common ideals.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.795
And that by giving back
to our communities,

00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:47.594
by serving people in need,
we reaffirm our ideals --

00:02:47.594 --> 00:02:51.394
in defiance of those who
would do us grave harm.

00:02:51.394 --> 00:02:53.895
We prove that the sense of
responsibility that we felt for

00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:59.361
one another that day nine years ago was not a fleeting passion

00:02:59.361 --> 00:03:02.094
-- but a lasting virtue.

00:03:02.094 --> 00:03:05.227
This is a difficult time for our country.

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:08.227
And it's often in such
moments that some try to stoke

00:03:08.227 --> 00:03:12.027
bitterness -- to divide us based on our differences,

00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:15.094
to blind us to what
we have in common.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:18.961
But on this day, we are
reminded that at our best,

00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:21.795
we do not give in
to this temptation.

00:03:21.795 --> 00:03:23.761
We stand with one another.

00:03:23.761 --> 00:03:26.394
We fight alongside one another.

00:03:26.394 --> 00:03:28.961
We do not allow ourselves
to be defined by fear,

00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.494
but rather by the hopes we have for our families,

00:03:32.494 --> 00:03:35.994
for our nation, and for a brighter future.

00:03:35.994 --> 00:03:38.895
So let us grieve for
those we've lost,

00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:43.161
honor those who have sacrificed,
and do our best to live up to

00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:48.294
the shared values that we have -- on this day,

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:51.227
and every day that follows.

00:03:51.227 --> 00:03:52.361
Thank you.
