00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.500
The President:
On Wednesday, I addressed a joint session of Congress and

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.734
the American people about why we
need health insurance reform and

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:13.834
what it will take to do it.

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:16.867
Since then, I've continued to
hear from many Americans across

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:20.900
the country about why this
is so urgent and important.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.400
I've heard from Americans who
can't get health coverage;

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.300
men and women who worry that one
accident or illness could drive

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.266
them into bankruptcy.

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.667
And I've heard from Americans
with insurance who thought that

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:34.333
"the uninsured" always
referred to someone else --

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:38.367
but between skyrocketing costs
and insurance company practices;

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:40.567
they're beginning to worry
that they could find themselves

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:42.166
uninsured too.

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.834
It's an anxiety that's keeping
more and more Americans awake at night.

00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:48.567
Over the last twelve months,
nearly six million more

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:50.734
Americans lost their
health coverage --

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:54.800
that's 17,000 men and
women every single day.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.300
We're not just talking about
Americans in poverty, either --

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.700
we're talking about
middle-class Americans.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.367
In other words, it
can happen to anyone.

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:05.433
And based on a brand-new report
from the Treasury Department,

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:10.133
we can expect that about half of
all Americans under 65 will lose

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:14.166
their health coverage at some
point over the next ten years.

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.834
If you're under the
age of 21 today,

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:20.033
chances are more than half that
you'll find yourself uninsured

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:22.200
at some point in that time.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.333
And more than one-third of
Americans will go without

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:27.033
coverage for longer
than one year.

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:29.633
I refuse to allow
that future to happen.

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:33.000
In the United States of America,
no one should have to worry that

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.867
they'll go without
health insurance --

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:38.800
not for one year, not for
one month, not for one day.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.033
And once I sign my health
reform plan into law -- they won't.

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:45.567
My plan will provide more
security and stability to those

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:48.333
who have health
insurance; offer quality,

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:51.300
affordable choices to
those who currently don't;

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.500
and bring health care costs for
our families, our businesses,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.400
and our government
under control.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.066
First of all, if you are among
the hundreds of millions of

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:03.266
Americans who already have
insurance through your job,

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:06.367
or Medicare, or
Medicaid, or the VA,

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:09.867
nothing in my plan will require
you or your employer to change

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:12.600
the coverage or the
doctor you have.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.033
What my plan will do is make the
insurance you have work better for you.

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:19.367
We'll make it illegal for
insurance companies to deny you

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:22.000
coverage because of a
pre-existing condition,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.133
or drop your coverage
when you get sick,

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:26.567
or water it down when
you need it the most.

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:29.233
They'll no longer be able to
place some arbitrary cap on the

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:32.200
amount of coverage you can
receive in a given year or over

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.533
a lifetime, and we will place
a limit on how much you can be

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:37.900
charged for
out-of-pocket expenses --

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.867
because no one should go broke
just because they get sick.

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:44.367
Second, if you're one of
the more than thirty million

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:46.667
Americans who
can't get coverage,

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:50.000
you'll finally have
quality, affordable choices.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.233
If you lose your
job, change your job,

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:56.300
or start your own business, you
will be able to get coverage.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.367
And as I've said
over and over again,

00:02:58.367 --> 00:03:03.667
I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits -- period.

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:05.767
This plan will be paid for.

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:08.166
The middle-class will
realize greater security,

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:09.800
not higher taxes.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.400
And if we can successfully slow
the growth of health care costs

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.467
by just one-tenth
of 1% each year,

00:03:15.467 --> 00:03:21.533
it will actually reduce the
deficit by $4 trillion over the long term.

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:24.600
Affordable, quality care within
reach for the tens of millions

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.900
of Americans who
don't have it today.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.333
Stability and security for the
hundreds of millions who do.

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:32.767
That's the reform we seek.

00:03:32.767 --> 00:03:35.233
We have had a long
and important debate.

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:37.000
But now is the time for action.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.767
Because every day we wait, more
Americans will lose their health

00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:42.500
care, their businesses,
and their homes --

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.033
but also the dreams they've
worked for and the peace of mind

00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:46.633
they deserve.

00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:49.066
They are why we have to succeed.

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:51.734
So if you're willing to put
country before party and the

00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:54.500
interests of our
children above our own;

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.500
if you refuse to settle for a
politics where scoring points is

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.166
more important than solving
problems; and if you believe,

00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:05.467
as I do, that America can still
come together to do great things

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:06.734
-- then join us.

00:04:06.734 --> 00:04:07.900
Give us your help.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.133
And we will finally get health
insurance reform done this year.
