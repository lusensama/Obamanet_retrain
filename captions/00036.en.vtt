00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.578
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:14.347
This week, there was a big
birthday you might have missed.

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:17.784
Medicare and Medicaid
turned 50 years old.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.487
And that's something
worth celebrating.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:22.989
If one of the best measures
of a country is how it treats

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.726
its more vulnerable citizens
- seniors, the poor,

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:31.131
the sick - then America
has a lot to be proud of.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.232
Think about it.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:35.902
Before Social Security, too
many seniors lived in poverty.

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:40.740
Before Medicare, only half had
some form of health insurance.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.676
Before Medicaid, parents
often had no help covering

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:47.614
the cost of care for a
child with a disability.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.916
But as Americans, we
declared that our citizens

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:53.453
deserve a basic measure
of security and dignity.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.622
And today, the poverty
rate for seniors is less

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:59.125
than half of what it
was fifty years ago.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:02.395
Every American over 65
has access to affordable

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.530
health care.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.266
And today, we're finally
finishing the job -

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.268
since I signed the
Affordable Care Act

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.970
into law, the uninsured
rate for all Americans has

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.073
fallen by about one-third.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:16.976
These promises we made as a
nation have saved millions

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:19.345
of our own people from
poverty and hardship,

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:22.048
allowing us new freedom,
new independence,

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:25.084
and the chance to live
longer, better lives.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.086
That's something
to be proud of.

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.087
It's heroic.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:30.490
These endeavors - these American
endeavors - they didn't

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.091
just make us a
better country.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:36.062
They reaffirmed that
we are a great country.

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:39.399
And a great country keeps
the promises it makes.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.601
Today, we're often told
that Medicare and Medicaid

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:42.969
are in crisis.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.805
But that's usually a political
excuse to cut their funding,

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:49.676
privatize them, or phase them
out entirely - all of which

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:52.545
would undermine their
core guarantee.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:55.815
The truth is, these
programs aren't in crisis.

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:58.218
Nor have they kept us
from cutting our deficits

00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:00.887
by two-thirds since
I took office.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:03.656
What is true is that
every month, another 250,000

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:06.626
Americans turn 65
years old, and become

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:07.627
eligible for Medicare.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.929
And we all deserve a
health care system

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.665
that delivers efficient,
high-quality care.

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.701
So to keep these
programs strong,

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.970
we'll have to make
smart changes over time,

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.805
just like we always have.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.174
Today, we're actually
proving that's possible.

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:23.176
The Affordable Care Act
has already helped secure

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.945
Medicare's funding
for another 13 years.

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:28.448
The Affordable Care Act has
saved more than nine million

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:31.050
folks on Medicare 15
billion dollars on their

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.051
prescription drugs

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:36.322
It has expanded Medicaid to
help cover 12.8 million more

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.859
Americans, and to help more
seniors live independently.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.395
And we're moving our health
care system toward models

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:44.964
that reward the quality
of the care you receive,

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:47.400
not the quantity of
care you receive.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.470
That means healthier
Americans and a healthier

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.105
federal budget.

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.440
Today, these programs are
so fundamental to our way

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.010
of life that it's easy to
forget how hard people

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.579
fought against them
at the time.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.581
When FDR created
Social Security,

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:03.683
critics called
it socialism.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.819
When JFK and LBJ worked
to create Medicare,

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.856
the cynics said it would
take away our freedom.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.991
But ultimately, we came
to see these programs for

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:14.794
what they truly are - a
promise that if we work hard,

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:17.130
and play by the rules,
we'll be rewarded with

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.933
a basic measure of
dignity, security,

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:23.303
and the freedom to live
our lives as we want.

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:26.205
It's a promise that previous
generations made to us,

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:29.943
and a promise that our
generation has to keep.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.611
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
