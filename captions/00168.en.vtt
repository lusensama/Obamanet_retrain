00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:11.461
The President:
This weekend, millions of
our fellow Americans are still

00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:13.761
picking up the pieces from
one of the worst storms in

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:15.227
our history.

00:00:15.227 --> 00:00:17.695
I toured New Jersey on Wednesday
with Governor Christie,

00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:21.227
and witnessed some of the
terrible devastation firsthand.

00:00:21.227 --> 00:00:22.861
It's heartbreaking.

00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:24.761
Families have lost loved ones.

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:27.428
Entire communities
have been wiped away.

00:00:27.428 --> 00:00:30.094
Even some of the first
responders who repeatedly put

00:00:30.094 --> 00:00:33.261
themselves in harm's way to
bravely save the lives of others

00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:36.094
have suffered
losses of their own.

00:00:36.094 --> 00:00:39.161
Today, I ask everyone to
keep them in your prayers.

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:43.594
And as President, I promise them
this: your country will be there

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:48.728
for you for as long as it
takes to recover and rebuild.

00:00:48.728 --> 00:00:51.127
Throughout the week, I've
been in constant contact with

00:00:51.127 --> 00:00:53.161
governors and mayors
in the affected areas,

00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:55.428
who are doing an excellent
job in extraordinarily

00:00:55.428 --> 00:00:57.127
difficult circumstances.

00:00:57.127 --> 00:00:59.861
And we owe the first responders
and National Guardsmen who have

00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:03.494
been working around the
clock our deepest gratitude.

00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:06.061
Our number one concern has been
making sure that affected states

00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:09.628
and communities have everything
they need to respond to and

00:01:09.628 --> 00:01:11.594
recover from this storm.

00:01:11.594 --> 00:01:14.261
From the earliest hours, I
ordered that resources be made

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:17.594
available to states in the path
of the storm as soon as they

00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:18.594
needed them.

00:01:18.594 --> 00:01:21.494
And I instructed my team not to
let red tape and bureaucracy get

00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:23.294
in the way of
solving problems --

00:01:23.294 --> 00:01:26.328
especially when it came to
making sure local utilities

00:01:26.328 --> 00:01:29.528
could restore power as
quickly as possible.

00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:32.594
Before the storm hit, FEMA
pre-staged emergency response

00:01:32.594 --> 00:01:34.628
teams from North
Carolina to Maine,

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:36.994
and deployed resources
like food, water,

00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:39.294
and generators up
and down the coast.

00:01:39.294 --> 00:01:42.127
As the storm passed, thousands
of FEMA personnel were on the

00:01:42.127 --> 00:01:44.394
ground responding
to those in need.

00:01:44.394 --> 00:01:47.695
And by midweek, the Department
of Defense was ready to fly in

00:01:47.695 --> 00:01:50.795
cargo planes that could be
loaded with trucks and equipment

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:55.061
to help local power companies
get up and running faster.

00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:57.027
But recovery will
still be a long,

00:01:57.027 --> 00:01:59.227
hard road for many communities.

00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:01.261
There's a lot of work ahead.

00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:04.795
If you've been directly impacted
by this storm and need temporary

00:02:04.795 --> 00:02:06.994
assistance getting
back on your feet,

00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:13.328
you can call 1-800-621-FEMA,
1-800-621-FEMA,

00:02:13.328 --> 00:02:17.528
or apply at DisasterAssistance.gov.

00:02:17.528 --> 00:02:19.761
If you know folks who
are still without power,

00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:22.561
please spread the word
and let them know.

00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:25.328
And if you don't live in an
affected area and want to help,

00:02:25.328 --> 00:02:30.061
supporting the Red Cross is
the best and fastest way.

00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:33.461
This week, we've been humbled
by nature's destructive power.

00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:35.928
But we've been inspired as well.

00:02:35.928 --> 00:02:38.695
For when the storm was darkest,
the heroism of our fellow

00:02:38.695 --> 00:02:41.227
citizens shone brightest.

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:44.428
The nurses and doctors at NYU
Medical Center who evacuated

00:02:44.428 --> 00:02:48.328
fragile newborns, carrying some
down several flights of stairs.

00:02:48.328 --> 00:02:51.428
The firefighters in Queens who
battled an inferno from flooded

00:02:51.428 --> 00:02:55.428
streets, and rescued people from
an apartment building by boat.

00:02:55.428 --> 00:02:58.061
The Coast Guard crews from North
Carolina who saved a sinking

00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:01.294
ship in stormy seas -- and
their rescue swimmer who,

00:03:01.294 --> 00:03:04.628
when he reached those in need,
said, "I'm Dan, and I hear you

00:03:04.628 --> 00:03:06.594
"guys need a ride."

00:03:06.594 --> 00:03:08.061
That's who we are.

00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:09.061
We're Americans.

00:03:09.061 --> 00:03:11.294
When times are
tough, we're tougher.

00:03:11.294 --> 00:03:12.761
We put others first.

00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:14.795
We go that extra mile.

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:17.761
We open our hearts and
our homes to one another,

00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:19.895
as one American family.

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:24.227
We recover, we rebuild,
we come back stronger --

00:03:24.227 --> 00:03:27.461
and together we will
do that once more.

00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:30.294
Thanks, God bless you,
and God bless America.
