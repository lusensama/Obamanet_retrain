00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.644
The President:
Hi everybody.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.147
Today, I'm at Del Sol High
School, in Las Vegas,

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.416
to talk with students and
families about immigration.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:19.052
We are a nation of
immigrants.

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:21.221
It has always given
America a big advantage

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:22.889
over other nations.

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:26.826
It keeps our country young,
dynamic, and entrepreneurial.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:28.828
But today, our immigration
system is broken,

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:30.864
and everybody knows it.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.866
That's why, nearly
two years ago, I came

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.868
to this school and
laid out principles

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.403
for immigration reform.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.738
And five months later,
Democrats, Republicans,

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.740
and Independents in the
Senate came together

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.676
to pass a commonsense
compromise bill.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.678
That bill would have
secured our border,

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.680
while giving undocumented
immigrants who already

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.450
live here a pathway to
citizenship if they

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.719
paid a fine, started
paying their taxes,

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.954
and went to the back
of the line.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.856
Independent experts
said it would grow

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:59.826
our economy, and
shrink our deficits.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.895
Now, had the House of
Representatives allowed

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.330
a yes-or-no vote on
that kind of bill,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.367
it would have passed with
support from both parties.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.402
Today it would be the law.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.471
But for a year and a
half, Republican leaders

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:14.274
in the House have refused to
allow that simple vote.

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:16.543
Now, I still believe that
the best way to solve this

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:19.012
problem is by working
together -- both parties --

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:21.014
to pass that kind
of bipartisan law.

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:23.883
But until that happens,
there are actions I have

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:26.486
the legal authority to
take as President --

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:28.721
the same kinds of actions
taken by Democratic

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.723
and Republican
Presidents before me --

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.725
that will help make
our immigration system

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.094
more fair and more just.

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:37.063
I took those actions
this week.

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.065
We're providing more
resources at the border

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:41.067
to help law enforcement
personnel stop

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:43.069
illegal crossings, and
send home those who

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.537
do cross over.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.539
We'll focus enforcement
resources on people who

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.143
are threats to our security
-- felons, not families;

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.245
criminals, not children.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.414
And we'll bring more
undocumented immigrants

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:56.749
out of the shadows so they
can play by the rules,

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.552
pay their full share of taxes,
pass a criminal background

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:02.255
check, and get
right with the law.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:04.557
Nothing about this action
will benefit anyone who

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:07.293
has come to this country
recently, or who might try

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.362
and come to America
illegally in the future.

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:12.899
It does not grant citizenship,
or the right to stay here

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.635
permanently, or offer
the same benefits

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:18.004
that citizens receive.

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:19.339
And it's certainly
not amnesty,

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.674
no matter how often
the critics say it.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:24.277
Amnesty is the immigration
system we have today --

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:26.279
millions of people living
here without paying

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.615
their taxes, or
playing by the rules.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.617
And the actions I took
this week will finally

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:31.951
start fixing that.

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.953
As you might have heard,
there are Members

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:35.955
of Congress who question
my authority to make

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:37.924
our immigration
system work better.

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:40.493
Well, I have one answer
for that: Pass a bill.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:43.530
The day I sign it into law,
the actions I've taken

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.132
to help solve this problem
will no longer be necessary.

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:49.636
In the meantime, we can't
allow a disagreement over

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:52.772
a single issue to be a
dealbreaker on every issue.

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:55.041
That's not how our
democracy works.

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:58.011
This debate deserves more
than politics as usual.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.913
It's important
for our future.

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:01.915
It's about who we
are, and the future

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:03.783
we want to build.

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:05.919
We are only here because
this country welcomed

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.488
our forebears, and taught
them that being American

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.823
is about more than what
we look like or where

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:12.358
we come from.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:15.061
What makes us Americans
is our shared commitment

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:18.197
to an ideal -- that all
of us are created equal,

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:20.199
and all of us have the
chance to make of our

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.801
lives what we will.

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:23.803
That's the country we
inherited, and it's

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:26.906
the one we have to leave
for future generations.

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:29.642
Thank you, God bless you,
and have a great weekend.
