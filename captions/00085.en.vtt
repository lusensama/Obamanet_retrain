00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.910
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.947
Our businesses have now
added nearly 10 million

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:16.383
new jobs over the
past 52 months.

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:19.052
The unemployment rate is
at its lowest point since

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:22.722
September 2008 -- the
fastest one-year drop

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:23.890
in nearly 30 years.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.827
401(k)s are growing, fewer
homes are underwater,

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:30.997
and for the first time in more
than a decade, business

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:33.032
leaders around the world
have declared that

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:36.569
the world's number one place
to invest isn't China;

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.571
it's the United States of
America --

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:39.773
and our lead is growing.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:43.042
None of this
is an accident.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.044
It's thanks to the
resilience and resolve

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:47.046
of the American people that
our country

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.482
has recovered faster and come
farther than almost

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.484
any other advanced nation on Earth.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.554
But there's another
trend that threatens

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:57.257
to undermine the progress
you've helped make.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:00.293
Even as corporate profits
are as high as ever,

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:02.962
a small but growing group
of big corporations

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:06.533
are fleeing the country to
get out of paying taxes.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.535
They're keeping most of
their business inside

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.104
the United States, but they're
basically renouncing

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.106
their citizenship and declaring
that they're

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.508
based somewhere else, just to
avoid

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.676
paying their fair share.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:20.113
I want to be clear:
this is only

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:22.782
a few big corporations so far.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:24.784
The vast majority of
American businesses pay

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.786
their taxes right here
in the United States.

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:30.390
But when some companies
cherrypick their taxes,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.792
it damages the
country's finances.

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:34.494
It adds to the deficit.

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:37.363
It makes it harder to
invest in the things that

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:40.066
will keep America strong,
and it sticks

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:44.304
you with the tab for what they
stash offshore.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.406
Right now, a loophole in
our tax laws makes this

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.708
totally legal -- and I
think

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:50.677
that's totally wrong.

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:52.679
You don't get to pick
which rules you play

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.415
by, or which tax rate you pay,
and neither

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:56.416
should these companies.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:59.052
The best way to level the
playing field is through

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.554
tax reform that lowers the
corporate tax rate,

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.290
closes wasteful loopholes, and
simplifies

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.860
the tax code for everybody.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.862
But stopping companies
from renouncing

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.864
their citizenship just to get
out of paying

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:12.866
their fair share of taxes is
something

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.367
that cannot wait.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.736
That's why, in my budget
earlier this year,

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:19.305
I proposed closing this
unpatriotic

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.975
tax loophole for good.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.110
Democrats in Congress have
advanced proposals

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.012
that would do the same thing.

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:28.147
A couple Republicans have
indicated they want

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:30.884
to address this too, and
I hope more join us.

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.953
Rather than double-down
on the top-down

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:36.589
economics that let a fortunate
few play by their

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.626
own rules, let's embrace an
economic patriotism

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:42.495
that says we rise or fall
together, as one nation,

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.097
and as one people.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.466
Let's reward the hard work
of ordinary Americans

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.301
who play by the rules.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:50.436
Together, we can build up
our middle class,

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.605
hand down something better to
our kids,

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:55.008
and restore the American Dream for all

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:59.379
who work for it and study for it and strive for it.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.381
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
