00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:11.533
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:13.266
My number one priority
as President

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.333
is doing whatever I can to
create more jobs and opportunity

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.166
for hardworking families.

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.834
And yesterday, we learned
that businesses added

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:24.500
273,000 jobs last month.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.100
All told, our businesses
have now created

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.834
9.2 million new jobs over 50
consecutive months

00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:32.834
of job growth.

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:36.200
But we need to keep going
- to create more good

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.834
jobs, and give
middle-class

00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:40.100
families a sense of security.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.400
And I want to work with
Congress to do it.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:45.100
But so far this year,
Republicans

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.967
in Congress have blocked or
voted down every serious idea

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:52.200
to create jobs and strengthen
the middle class.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.100
They've said "no" to
raising the minimum wage,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.300
"no" to equal pay for
equal work, and "no"

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.700
to restoring the unemployment
insurance they

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.800
let expire for more than two
million Americans looking

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.800
for a new job.

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.066
That's not what
we need right now.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.800
Not when there are still
too many folks out

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.967
of work and too many families
working harder

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:12.100
than ever just to get by.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.166
That's why, in my State of
the Union Address,

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:18.066
I said that in this Year of
Action, whenever

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:21.100
I can act on my own to create
jobs and expand opportunity

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.700
for more Americans, I will.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.233
And since January, I've
taken more than

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:27.567
20 executive actions
to do just that.

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.400
I acted to raise more
workers' wages

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.633
by requiring that workers on
new federal contracts earn

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:36.934
a fair wage of at least
$10.10 an hour -

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:39.934
and as long as Republicans in
Congress refuse to act,

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:42.133
I'll keep working with
cities, states,

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:45.767
and businesses to give more
Americans a raise.

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:48.233
I acted to encourage more
pay transparency

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:51.066
and strengthen enforcement of
equal pay laws,

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:53.500
so that more women have the
tools they need

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.567
to earn fair pay.

00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:57.467
And I'm modernizing
regulations to make

00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:00.133
sure that more Americans who
work overtime

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:02.200
get the pay that they've earned.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.400
I've launched new hubs
to help attract more

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.000
high-tech manufacturing
jobs to America -

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.333
and ordered a reform of job
training programs

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:12.200
to make sure more Americans can
earn the skills that

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.767
employers need right now.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.533
I've brought together
business leaders

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:19.300
to help us connect more
classrooms to high-speed

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.800
internet, and give more of the
long-term

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.200
unemployed a better shot at
finding a job.

00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:28.066
Each of these steps
will make a difference.

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:30.400
You can check out the full
list at whitehouse.gov.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.967
But we could do a lot more
if Republicans

00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:36.900
in Congress were less interested
in stacking the deck in favor

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.433
of those at the top, and
more interested in growing

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:41.800
the economy for everybody.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.667
They've now voted more
than 50 times

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:46.266
to take apart the Affordable
Care Act -

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:49.767
imagine if they voted 50 times
on serious jobs bills.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.700
That's why I'm going to
take action

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.934
on my own wherever I can.

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:55.834
To grow our economy from
the middle-out,

00:02:55.834 --> 00:02:57.400
not the top down.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.800
To give every American who
works hard a chance

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.867
to get ahead.

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:03.867
That's what this Year of
Action is all about,

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:06.233
and that's what I'm going
to keep fighting for.

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:08.166
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
