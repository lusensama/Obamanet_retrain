00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.378
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.481
Next week marks seven years
since a financial crisis on

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:17.417
Wall Street that would usher
in some hard years for

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.753
working families
on Main Street.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.654
Soon after that,
I took office.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:24.190
And we set out to rebuild
our economy on a new

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.094
foundation for growth and
prosperity by investing in

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:31.197
things that grow our middle
class - things like jobs,

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.000
health care, and education.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.636
Today, our businesses have
created more than 13 million

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:39.372
new jobs over the last
five and a half years.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:41.474
The unemployment rate is the
lowest it's been in more

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.009
than seven years.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:45.011
Another 16 million
Americans have gained

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:46.312
health insurance.

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.314
Our high school graduate
rate is the highest it's

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:51.818
ever been, and more people
are graduating from college

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.620
than ever before.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.823
We are coming back
- and stronger.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.526
Still, in an economy that's
increasingly based on

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.896
knowledge and innovation,
some higher education

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.665
is the surest ticket
to the middle class.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:08.568
By the end of this decade,
two in three job openings

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.104
will require some
higher education.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.506
That's one reason why a
degree from a two-year

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:17.677
college will earn you
$10,000 more each year than

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:20.747
someone who only
finished high school.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.882
One study showed that a
degree from a four-year

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.385
university earns you $1
million more over the

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.455
course of a lifetime.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:30.824
The country with the
best-educated workforce

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:35.161
in the world is going to win
the 21st century economy.

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.363
I want that to be America.

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.766
But as college costs and
student debt keep rising,

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.535
the choices that Americans
make when searching for and

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:46.239
selecting a college have
never been more important.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:49.108
That's why everyone should
be able to find clear,

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:52.345
reliable, open data on
college affordability

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:55.482
and value - like whether
they're likely to graduate,

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.785
find good jobs, and
pay off their loans.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.721
Right now, however, many
existing college rankings

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.657
reward schools for spending
more money and rejecting

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.393
more students - at a time
when America needs our

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.395
colleges to focus on
affordability and

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:12.065
supporting all
students who enroll.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:15.235
That doesn't make sense,
and it has to change.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:17.537
So, today, my Administration
is launching a new

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:20.874
College Scorecard, designed
with input from those who will

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:25.912
use it the most - students,
families, and counselors.

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:28.615
Americans will now have
access to reliable data

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:31.451
on every institution
of higher education.

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:33.887
You'll be able to see how
much each school's graduates

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:37.123
earn, how much debt they
graduate with, and what

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:39.659
percentage of a school's
students can pay back

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.662
their loans - which will help
all of us see which schools

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:46.232
do the best job of preparing
America for success.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.535
And to reach more folks,
we're working with partners

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:52.071
in the academic, non-profit,
and private sectors that

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:54.774
will help families use this
new data to navigate the

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:59.646
complicated college process
and make informed decisions.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:02.282
The status quo serves some
colleges and the companies

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.117
that rank them just fine.

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:06.786
But it doesn't serve our
students well - and that

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:08.821
doesn't serve
any of us well.

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:11.357
There are colleges dedicated
to helping students of all

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:15.194
backgrounds learn without
saddling them with debt.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.463
We should hold everybody
to that standard.

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:20.199
Our economic future
depends on it.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.834
This work is
just beginning.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.803
In the coming weeks and
months, we'll continue

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:25.805
to improve the Scorecard
based on what we learn from

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:28.141
students, parents,
counselors, and

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.976
colleges themselves.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.978
The goal is to help
everybody who's willing

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:34.447
to work for a higher
education search for

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:38.117
and select a college
that fits their goals.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:40.253
Together, we can make sure
that every student has

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:42.989
the chance to get a great
education and achieve

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.024
their full potential.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.092
Thanks, everybody.

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.093
And have a great weekend.
