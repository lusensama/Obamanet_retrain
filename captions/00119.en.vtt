The President:
Hello everyone.

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.734
Veterans' Day Weekend is a
chance for all of us to say

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:12.800
two simple words: "Thank you."

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.734
Thank you to that
greatest generation

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:17.633
who fought island by island
across the Pacific,

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:20.033
and freed millions from
fascism in Europe.

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:22.300
Thank you to the heroes
who risked everything

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.133
through the bitter cold of Korea

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.600
and the stifling
heat of Vietnam.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.900
And thank you to all the
heroes who have served since,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.567
most recently our 9/11
Generation of veterans

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:35.233
from Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:36.834
Now that more of
them are coming home,

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:39.233
we need to serve them
as well as they served us.

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:41.667
That requires more
than a simple "thank you" -

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:45.000
especially from those of us
who've been elected to serve.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.734
I've often said that my top
priority is growing the economy,

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:51.767
creating new jobs, and
restoring middle-class security.

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:54.433
And a very important
part of that is making sure

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:56.734
that every veteran
has every chance

00:00:56.734 --> 00:01:00.767
to share in the opportunity
he or she has helped defend.

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:03.333
In addition to the care
and benefits they've earned -

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:06.166
including good mental
health care to stay strong -

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.667
that means a good job,
a good education,

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:11.900
and a home to call their own.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.467
If you fight for
your country overseas,

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:17.467
you should never have to fight
for a job when you come home.

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:19.900
I've made sure the federal
government leads by example,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.066
and since I took office,

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.200
we've hired about
300,000 veterans

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.700
to keep serving their country.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.367
Our new transition assistance
program is helping veterans

00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:32.233
and their spouses find that
new job and plan their career.

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:34.033
And I'm going to keep
calling on Congress

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:37.734
to do the right thing and
pass the Veterans Jobs Corps.

00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:41.333
Put our veterans to
work rebuilding America.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:44.834
Our troops gain unmatched skills
while serving in harm's way.

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:46.633
So we're also doing
everything we can to connect

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:49.533
more businesses with
highly-skilled veterans.

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.066
More help with job searches.

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:53.667
More tools to connect
veterans to job openings.

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:56.266
More chances to earn
licenses and credentials

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.367
for civilian jobs.

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:00.800
And new tax credits for
companies that hire veterans

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.533
and wounded warriors -

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:05.166
tax credits which Congress 
should make permanent.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.467
And America's
businesses have worked

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:10.767
with Michelle and Jill Biden's 
Joining Forces campaign

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:13.700
to help returning heroes find 
jobs in the private sector.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.867
They've already hired
or trained 290,000 veterans

00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:18.467
and military spouses,

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:21.800
and they've committed to
hiring over 400,000 more.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.567
We're also committed to giving
today's veterans and their

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:27.734
families the same shot at a
great education this country

00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:31.333
gave my grandfather when he
came home from World War II.

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:33.133
We're helping more of
them earn their degrees

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:35.500
under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.767
We've worked with thousands of
schools across the country

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:41.266
to set new standards to protect
against dishonest recruiting

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:44.100
and predatory lending practices
that target our veterans.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.667
And we're helping hundreds
of community colleges

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:49.333
and universities do more
to welcome and encourage

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:51.600
our veterans on campus.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.734
Thanks to these efforts,

00:02:52.734 --> 00:02:54.767
and the efforts
of the private sector,

00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:57.467
we've made progress getting
our vets back to work.

00:02:57.467 --> 00:02:59.867
But we've got
a lot more work to do.

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:01.767
And as more than
a million of our troops

00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:03.500
return to civilian life,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.600
we're going to have
to work even harder.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.367
Because the skill,
dedication, and courage

00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:10.567
of our troops is unmatched -

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:11.900
and when they come home,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.000
we all benefit from
their efforts to build

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.667
a stronger America and
a brighter future for our kids.

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:21.600
So to all our veterans,
on behalf our entire nation,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.467
thank you
for everything you've done

00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:26.100
and will continue
to do for our country.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.867
As your Commander-in-Chief,
I'm proud of your service,

00:03:28.867 --> 00:03:31.166
and grateful for your sacrifice.

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:32.567
And as long as
I'm your President,

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:34.667
I will make it my
mission to make sure

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:36.500
that America has your back,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.934
not just on
one day or one weekend,

00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:41.600
but 365 days a year.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.734
Thanks.

00:03:42.734 --> 00:03:44.633
God bless you,
and have a great weekend.
