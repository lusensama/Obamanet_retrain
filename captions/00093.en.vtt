00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.734
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:14.567
I'm here at Children's National
Medical Center in Washington,

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:18.166
D.C., visiting with some
kids being treated here

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:21.633
all the time for asthma and
other breathing problems.

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:25.100
Often, these illnesses are
aggravated by air pollution --

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.500
pollution from the same
sources that release

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.667
carbon and contribute
to climate change.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:32.367
And for the sake
of all our kids,

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:35.667
we've got to do
more to reduce it.

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:38.033
Earlier this month, hundreds
of scientists declared

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:41.700
that climate change is no
longer a distant threat --

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.133
it "has moved firmly
into the present."

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.934
Its costs can be measured in
lost lives and livelihoods,

00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:52.800
lost homes and businesses;
and higher prices for food,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
insurance, and rebuilding.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.967
That's why, last year, I
put forward America's

00:00:57.967 --> 00:01:00.767
first climate action plan.

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:03.767
This plan cuts carbon pollution
by building a clean energy

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:07.367
economy - using more clean
energy, less dirty energy,

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:10.133
and wasting less energy
throughout our economy.

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:14.100
One of the best things we can
do for our economy, our health,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.567
and our environment is to lead
the world in producing cleaner,

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:21.000
safer energy - and we're already
generating more clean energy

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
than ever before.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.934
Thanks in part to the
investments we made

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:27.867
in the Recovery Act, the electricity
America generates

00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:30.100
from wind has tripled.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.266
And from the sun, it's
increased more than tenfold.

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.367
In fact, every four minutes,
another American home

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:40.834
or business goes solar -- and
every panel is pounded into

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:46.367
place by a worker whose job
cannot be shipped overseas.

00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:47.633
We're wasting less energy, too.

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:51.066
We've doubled how far our cars
and trucks will go on a gallon

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:52.600
of gas by the middle
of the next decade,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.567
saving you money at the pump,
and we're helping families

00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:59.033
and businesses save billions
with more efficient homes,

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:01.300
buildings, and appliances.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.266
This strategy has created
jobs, grown our economy,

00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:07.433
and helped make America more
energy independent than we've

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:10.934
been in decades - all while
holding our carbon emissions

00:02:10.934 --> 00:02:14.033
to levels not seen
in about 20 years.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:15.433
It's a good start.

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:19.133
But for the sake of our
children, we have to do more.

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:21.367
This week, we will.

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:24.834
Today, about 40% of America's
carbon pollution comes

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:26.533
from power plants.

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:29.600
But right now, there are no
national limits to the amount of

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.900
carbon pollution that
existing plants can pump into

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.333
the air we breathe.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:35.900
None.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.066
We limit the amount of toxic
chemicals like mercury, sulfur,

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:42.100
and arsenic that power plants
put in our air and water.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.166
But they can dump unlimited
amounts of carbon pollution

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:46.800
into the air.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.033
It's not smart, it's not safe,
and it doesn't make sense.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:54.333
That's why, a year ago, I
directed the Environmental

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:57.633
Protection Agency to build on
the efforts of many states,

00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:01.233
cities, and companies, and come
up with commonsense guidelines

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:05.200
for reducing dangerous carbon
pollution from our power plants.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.166
This week, we're unveiling
these proposed guidelines,

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:11.133
which will cut down on the
carbon pollution, smog,

00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:14.266
and soot that threaten the
health of the most vulnerable

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:17.967
Americans, including
children and the elderly.

00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:20.433
In just the first year that
these standards go into effect,

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:24.200
up to 100,000 asthma
attacks and 2,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.000
100 heart attacks will be
avoided - and those numbers will

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
go up from there.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.200
These standards were created in
an open and transparent way,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.567
with input from the
business community.

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:37.233
States and local governments
weighed in, too.

00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:41.333
In fact, nearly a dozen states
are already implementing their

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:45.100
own market-based programs
to reduce carbon pollution.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.133
And over 1,000 mayors have
signed agreements to cut their

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:50.533
cities' carbon pollution.

00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:53.200
So the idea of setting higher
standards to cut pollution

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.567
at our power plants is not new.

00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:57.633
It's just time for Washington
to catch up with the rest

00:03:57.633 --> 00:03:59.033
of the country.

00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:02.900
Now, special interests and their
allies in Congress will claim

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.367
that these guidelines will kill
jobs and crush the economy.

00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:09.166
Let's face it, that's
what they always say.

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:13.767
But every time America has set
clear rules and better standards

00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:17.700
for our air, our water, and our
children's health - the warnings

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.400
of the cynics and naysayers
have been wrong.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.600
They warned that doing something
about the smog choking

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.533
our cities, and acid rain poisoning
our lakes, would kill business.

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:29.066
It didn't.

00:04:29.066 --> 00:04:32.633
Our air got cleaner, acid
rain was cut dramatically,

00:04:32.633 --> 00:04:35.400
and our economy kept growing.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.900
These excuses for inaction
somehow suggest a lack of faith

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.166
in American businesses
and American ingenuity.

00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:44.567
The truth is, when we ask
our workers and businesses

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:47.367
to innovate, they do.

00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:50.233
When we raise the
bar, they meet it.

00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:52.266
When we restricted
cancer-causing chemicals

00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:55.200
in plastics and leaded
fuel in our cars,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.700
American chemists came up
with better substitutes.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.233
When we phased out the gases
that depleted the ozone layer,

00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:04.600
American workers built
better refrigerators

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.533
and air conditioners.

00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:09.033
The fuel standards we put in
place a few years ago didn't

00:05:09.033 --> 00:05:12.333
cripple automakers; the American
auto industry retooled,

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:15.200
and today, they're selling
the best cars in the world,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.633
with more hybrids, plug-in, and
fuel-efficient models to choose

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:22.133
from than ever before.

00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:24.266
In America, we don't have to
choose between the health

00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:27.433
of our economy and the
health of our children.

00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:29.800
The old rules may say we can't
protect our environment

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.834
and promote economic growth at
the same time, but in America,

00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:37.467
we've always used new technology
to break the old rules.

00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:41.100
As President, and as a
parent, I refuse to condemn

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.633
our children to a planet
that's beyond fixing.

00:05:44.633 --> 00:05:48.533
The shift to a cleaner energy
economy won't happen overnight,

00:05:48.533 --> 00:05:51.367
and it will require tough
choices along the way.

00:05:51.367 --> 00:05:54.533
But a low-carbon, clean energy
economy can be an engine

00:05:54.533 --> 00:05:57.100
of growth for decades to come.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.967
America will build that engine.

00:05:59.967 --> 00:06:01.867
America will build the future.

00:06:01.867 --> 00:06:04.333
A future that's cleaner,
more prosperous,

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:07.967
and full of good jobs -- a future
where we can look our kids

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:12.033
in the eye and tell them we did
our part to leave them a safer,

00:06:12.033 --> 00:06:13.867
more stable world.

00:06:13.867 --> 00:06:16.166
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
