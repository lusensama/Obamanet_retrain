President Obama:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.834
In this year of action, I
said I'd do everything

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:16.700
in my power to expand
opportunity

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.467
for more Americans.

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:20.333
And this week, I took
action to lift more

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.834
workers' wages by
requiring federal

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:25.767
contractors to pay their
employees a fair wage

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:29.467
of at least $10.10 an hour.

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:31.934
These are workers who
serve our troops' meals,

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:35.133
wash their dishes,
care for our veterans -

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.200
Americans who work hard
and will get a raise

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.300
as these contracts come up.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.166
This will be good
for contractors, for

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.433
taxpayers, and for
America's bottom line.

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:47.233
We know why this
is important.

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:49.600
Our economy has been
growing for four years.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.000
Our businesses have
created eight

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.700
and a half million new jobs.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.266
But while those at the
top are doing better than

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.767
ever, average wages
have barely budged.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.867
Too many Americans are
working harder than ever

00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:02.767
just to get by, let
alone get ahead.

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:05.166
And that's been true since
long before

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.834
the recession hit.

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:08.433
That's why we've got to
build an economy that

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:12.100
works for everybody, not
just a fortunate few.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.767
We've got to restore
opportunity for all

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:17.333
-- the notion that no matter who
you are or how you started

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.467
out, with hard work and
responsibility,

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:22.166
you can get ahead in America.

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.300
The opportunity agenda
I've laid out is built

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.133
on more new jobs that
pay good wages; better

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.867
training for folks to
fill those jobs;

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:33.000
a smarter education for our
kids; and making sure honest

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.767
work is rewarded.

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:37.033
And the action I took this
week will reward

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:39.700
hard work for more Americans.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.567
But to finish the job,
Congress needs to act.

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:45.600
In the year since I first
asked Congress to raise

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.900
the minimum wage, six
states have passed

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.633
laws to raise theirs.

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:52.467
More states, cities,
counties, and companies

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:54.667
are taking steps
to join them.

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.367
An overwhelming majority
of Americans support

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.467
raising a minimum wage
that's worth about 20 percent

00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:03.433
less than when Ronald
Reagan took office.

00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:05.100
Right now, there's a bill
in Congress that would

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.233
boost America's minimum
wage to $10.10 an hour.

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:12.033
That's easy to
remember: ten-ten.

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:14.400
And remember, the average
worker who would get a

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.200
raise if Congress acts
is about 35 years old.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.567
Most lower-wage jobs
are held by women.

00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:23.433
And raising the minimum
wage wouldn't just raise

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:26.300
their wages - its effect
would lift wages for about

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.467
28 million Americans.

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:31.200
It would lift millions of
Americans out of poverty,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.500
and help millions more
work their way out of

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.667
poverty - without
requiring a single dollar

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:39.133
in new taxes or spending.

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.133
It will give more
businesses more customers

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:43.467
with more money to spend -
and that means growing the

00:02:43.467 --> 00:02:46.133
economy for everyone.

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:48.367
You deserve to know where
the people who represent

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:49.367
you stand on this.

00:02:49.367 --> 00:02:51.800
If they don't support
raising the federal

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.133
minimum wage to ten-ten an
hour, ask them "why not?"

00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:58.166
The opponents of raising
folks' wages have deployed

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:00.767
the same old arguments for
years, and time and again,

00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:02.533
they've been proven wrong.

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:04.000
Let's prove them wrong
again,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.333
and give America a raise.

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:08.000
Let's make opportunity
easier to come by for

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.033
every American who's
willing to work for it.

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:12.600
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
