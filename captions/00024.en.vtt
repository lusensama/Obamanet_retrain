00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.778
The President: Hi everybody.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.913
Our country is home to
some of the most beautiful

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:16.282
God-given landscapes
in the world.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:19.386
We're blessed with natural
treasures from the Grand Tetons

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:22.188
to the Grand Canyon,
from lush forests and vast

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:26.359
deserts to lakes and rivers
teeming with wildlife.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.862
And it's our responsibility
to protect these treasures

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.265
for future generations just
as previous generations

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.667
protected them for us.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:38.037
Since taking office I've set
aside more than 260 million

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:41.374
acres of public lands and
waters -- more than any

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.343
President in history.

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:46.079
Last month, we announced
that 11 states had come

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.948
together with ranchers and
industry groups to protect a

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:51.985
threatened species,
the sage grouse,

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:55.522
without jeopardizing
local economies.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.491
Two weeks ago we announced
that we're creating one new

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:01.227
marine sanctuary on the
Potomac River in Maryland

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:04.230
and another along Lake
Michigan in Wisconsin part

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.500
of unprecedented efforts to
restore the Chesapeake Bay

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.636
and the Great Lakes.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.439
We also joined a coalition
of countries cracking down

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.874
on illegal fishing that
threatened jobs and food

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.743
security around the globe.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.378
And I'm going to keep
protecting the places that

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:21.481
make America special and
the livelihoods of those who

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.616
depend on them.

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:26.085
We'll also keep doing what
we can to prevent the worst

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:29.789
effects of climate change
before it's too late.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.325
Over the past six years
we've led by example

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:34.360
generating more clean energy
and lowering

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.062
our carbon emissions.

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.731
Our businesses have stepped
up in a big way including

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.468
just this past week some of
our biggest companies made

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:45.138
new commitments to act on
climate not just because

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.240
it's good for the planet but
because it's good for

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.042
their bottom line.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.811
This is how America's
leading on the environment

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.214
and because America's
leading by example,

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:57.884
150 countries, representing
over 85 percent of global

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:01.588
emissions have now laid our
plans to reduce their levels

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:05.658
of the harmful carbon
pollution that warms our planet.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:08.161
It gives us great momentum
going into Paris this

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.997
December where the world
needs to come together and

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:13.166
build on these individual
commitments with an

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:16.135
ambitious, long-term
agreement to protect this

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:18.938
Earth for our kids.

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:21.474
Now Congress has
to do its job.

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.043
This month, even as
Republicans in Congress

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.646
barely manage to keep
our government open,

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.081
they shut down something
called the

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:31.184
Land and Water Conservation Fund.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:33.786
For more than half a century
this fund has protected more

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:37.390
than five million acres of
land from playgrounds to

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.393
parks to priceless
landscapes all without

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:43.429
costing taxpayers a dime.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.065
Nearly every single county
in America has benefitted

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.634
from this program.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:49.335
It has bipartisan support
in both

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:51.671
the House and the Senate.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.374
Republicans in Congress
should reauthorize and fully

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:59.546
fund the Land and Water
Conservation Fund without delay.

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:03.316
After all, as Pope Francis
reminds us so eloquently,

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:07.320
"This planet is a gift from
God and our common home.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.856
We should leave it to our
kids in better shape than we

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.624
found it."

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:15.628
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
