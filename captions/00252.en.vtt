00:00:08.594 --> 00:00:11.328
The President:
A few months ago, I received
a letter from a woman named

00:00:11.328 --> 00:00:13.194
Brenda Breece.

00:00:13.194 --> 00:00:15.528
I wanted to share her story
because it speaks to what a lot

00:00:15.528 --> 00:00:18.494
of families are going through --
and it offers a good example of

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:22.895
the kind of responsibility that's
needed in Washington right now.

00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:26.828
Brenda's a mom and a special
ed teacher from Missouri.

00:00:26.828 --> 00:00:29.761
Her husband, David, was employed
at the local Chrysler plant for

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.994
nearly four decades.

00:00:31.994 --> 00:00:34.361
They've worked hard
their whole lives.

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:38.027
But like a lot of folks, they've taken
some hits over the past few years.

00:00:38.027 --> 00:00:42.061
When the Chrysler plant closed,
David had to take early retirement.

00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:46.461
His pension helps, but it's
half of what he earned before.

00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:48.394
Meanwhile, because
of budget cuts,

00:00:48.394 --> 00:00:51.094
Brenda has had to buy school
supplies for her students out of

00:00:51.094 --> 00:00:57.227
her own pocket -- because it's her
job and she cares about those kids.

00:00:57.227 --> 00:01:00.795
Money has been tight, but
they're doing the best they can.

00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:03.428
And like so many families, they
are sacrificing what they don't

00:01:03.428 --> 00:01:06.928
need so they can afford
what really matters.

00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:08.895
This is what Brenda told me.

00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:11.328
"I feel my
family is frugal.

00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:13.661
"We go to the
movies...once a month,

00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:16.661
but usually we just wait for
them to come out on TV...

00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:20.261
I watch the food budget...We
combine trips into town [and]

00:01:20.261 --> 00:01:25.027
use coupons ... and we trim each
other's hair when we need a haircut."

00:01:25.027 --> 00:01:28.695
So Brenda and her husband know
what they can do without.

00:01:28.695 --> 00:01:32.761
But they also know what investments
are too important to sacrifice.

00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:35.828
Their daughter, Rachel, is a
sophomore in college with a 4.0

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:37.695
grade point average.

00:01:37.695 --> 00:01:39.194
The tuition's a big expense.

00:01:39.194 --> 00:01:41.728
But it's worth it, because it
will give her the chance to

00:01:41.728 --> 00:01:43.661
achieve her dreams.

00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:46.795
In fact, Brenda is looking
for a second job to ensure,

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:52.061
as she put it, "the money is there
to help Rachel with her future."

00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:54.661
Families across this country
understand what it takes to

00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:56.361
manage a budget.

00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:59.094
They understand what it takes to
make ends meet without forgoing

00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:02.227
important investments
like education.

00:02:02.227 --> 00:02:07.361
Well, it's time Washington acted
as responsibly as our families do.

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:10.194
And on Monday, I'm proposing a
new budget that will help us

00:02:10.194 --> 00:02:14.161
live within our means while
investing in our future.

00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:17.528
My budget freezes annual
domestic spending for the next

00:02:17.528 --> 00:02:21.061
five years -- even on programs
I care deeply about --

00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:25.194
which will reduce the deficit by
more than $400 billion over the

00:02:25.194 --> 00:02:27.027
next decade.

00:02:27.027 --> 00:02:30.161
This freeze will bring this type
of spending to its lowest level

00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:34.728
as a share of the economy since
Dwight Eisenhower was president.

00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:37.728
We've stripped down the budget
by getting rid of waste.

00:02:37.728 --> 00:02:40.227
For example, we're getting rid
of thousands of government-owned

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:43.761
buildings that sit empty
because they aren't needed.

00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:46.461
I've also proposed freezing
salaries for hardworking

00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:50.194
government employees, because
everyone has to do their part.

00:02:50.194 --> 00:02:52.261
And I'm going to make sure
politics doesn't add to our

00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:56.494
deficit, by vetoing any bill
that contains earmarks.

00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:59.027
And yet, just as the Breece
family is making difficult

00:02:59.027 --> 00:03:01.928
sacrifices while still
investing in the future --

00:03:01.928 --> 00:03:04.828
by helping, for instance, their
daughter pay her tuition --

00:03:04.828 --> 00:03:06.761
my budget does the same.

00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.428
I'm proposing that we invest in
what will do the most to grow

00:03:09.428 --> 00:03:11.594
the economy in
the years to come.

00:03:11.594 --> 00:03:14.261
This means job-creating
investments in roads,

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:16.828
high-speed rail, and broadband.

00:03:16.828 --> 00:03:19.261
This means cutting-edge research
that holds the promise of

00:03:19.261 --> 00:03:22.561
creating countless jobs
and whole new industries,

00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:25.428
like clean energy
and biotechnology.

00:03:25.428 --> 00:03:28.294
And it means improving our
schools and making college more

00:03:28.294 --> 00:03:31.194
affordable -- to give every
young person the chance to

00:03:31.194 --> 00:03:34.961
fulfill his or her potential,
and receive the job training

00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:37.161
they need to succeed.

00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:39.695
Because it would be a mistake
to balance the budget by

00:03:39.695 --> 00:03:42.928
sacrificing our
children's education.

00:03:42.928 --> 00:03:45.361
So, after a decade
of rising deficits,

00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:48.594
this budget asks Washington
to live within its means,

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:51.795
while at the same time
investing in our future.

00:03:51.795 --> 00:03:56.594
It cuts what we can't afford to
pay for what we cannot do without.

00:03:56.594 --> 00:03:58.761
That's what families
do in hard times.

00:03:58.761 --> 00:04:01.928
And that's what our
country has to do as well.

00:04:01.928 --> 00:04:03.194
Thanks so much.
