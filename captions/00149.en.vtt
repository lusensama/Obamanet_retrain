00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:07.467
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:10.066
For millions of Americans,
this is a special and sacred

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.667
time of year.

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.934
This week, Jewish families
gathered around the Seder table,

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:17.700
commemorating the Exodus from
Egypt and the triumph of faith

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.467
over oppression.

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:20.967
And this weekend,
Michelle, Malia,

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:24.066
Sasha and I will join Christians
around the world to celebrate

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:27.333
the Resurrection of Jesus
Christ and the hopeful promise

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.700
of Easter.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.934
In the midst of all of
our busy and noisy lives,

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:33.967
these holy days afford us the
precious opportunity to slow

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.600
down and spend some
quiet moments in prayer

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.400
and reflection.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.600
As Christians, my family and
I remember the incredible

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.700
sacrifice Jesus made for
each and every one of us --

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.266
how He took on the sins of the
world and extended the gift

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.533
of salvation.

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.834
And we recommit ourselves
to following His example

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:51.333
here on Earth.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.467
To loving our Lord and Savior.

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:55.000
To loving our neighbors.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.333
And to seeing in
everyone, especially

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:00.700
"the least of these,"
as a child of God.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.667
Of course, those values are
at the heart not just of the

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.900
Christian faith;
but of all faiths.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.533
From Judaism to Islam;
Hinduism to Sikhism;

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:12.033
there echoes a powerful call to
serve our brothers and sisters.

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:15.500
To keep in our hearts a deep
and abiding compassion for all.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.533
And to treat others as we
wish to be treated ourselves.

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.734
That's the common humanity
that binds us together.

00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:23.900
And as Americans, we're
united by something else,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.633
too: faith in the ideals
that lie at the heart of our

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:30.266
founding; and the belief that,
as part of something bigger than

00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:33.433
ourselves, we have a shared
responsibility to look out for

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:35.266
our fellow citizens.

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:38.333
So this weekend, I hope we're
all able to take a moment to

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.567
pause and reflect.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.400
To embrace our loved ones.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.433
To give thanks
for our blessings.

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:48.600
To rededicate ourselves to
interests larger than our own.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.500
And to all the Christian
families who are celebrating the

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.266
Resurrection, Michelle and
I wish you a blessed and

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.900
joyful Easter.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.900
God bless you.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.900
And may God continue to bless
the United States of America.
