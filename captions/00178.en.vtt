00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.967
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:09.233
Over the last few weeks,
there's been a lot of talk about

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:12.467
Medicare, with a lot of
accusations and misinformation

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:13.900
flying around.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.734
So today I want to step back for
a minute and share with you some

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:20.400
actual facts and news
about the program.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.166
This week, we found out that,
thanks to the health care law we

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:28.100
passed, nearly 5.4 million
seniors with Medicare have saved

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.533
over $4.1 billion on
prescription drugs.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.834
That's an average of more
than $700 per person.

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:39.800
And this year alone, 18 million
seniors with Medicare have taken

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.867
advantage of preventive care
benefits like mammograms or

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:46.934
other cancer screenings that
now come at no extra cost.

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:48.467
That's progress.

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:50.633
It means that seniors everywhere
are getting the care they

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:52.467
need for less.

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:55.133
And if you have questions about
what benefits you're entitled

00:00:55.133 --> 00:01:02.033
to, you can go to
www.medicare.gov to find out.

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:04.667
This news is also a reminder of
what's really at stake when we

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:06.767
talk about the
future of Medicare.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:10.000
It's not about overheated
rhetoric at election time.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.700
It's about a promise this
country made to our seniors that

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.433
says if you put in a
lifetime of hard work,

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:18.467
you shouldn't lose your home or
your life savings just because

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:19.767
you get sick.

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:22.834
Over the last 47 years, millions
of Americans have worked for

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:24.200
that promise.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.300
They've earned it.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.467
And for many seniors, the care
they've gotten through Medicare

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:29.867
has made all the
difference in the world.

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:31.367
Growing up as the
son of a single mom,

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:33.767
I was raised with the
help of my grandparents.

00:01:33.767 --> 00:01:36.400
I saw how important things like
Medicare and Social Security

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.934
were in their lives.

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:40.533
And I saw the peace
of mind it gave them.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.967
That's why, as President, my
goal has been to strengthen

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:46.934
these programs now, and preserve
them for future generations.

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:50.233
Because today's seniors deserve
that same peace of mind.

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:53.300
And the millions of Americans
who are working hard right now

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.567
deserve to know that the care
they need will be available when

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:58.233
they need it.

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:00.800
That's why, as part of
the Affordable Care Act,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.100
we gave seniors deeper
discounts on prescription drugs,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.133
and made sure preventive care
like mammograms are free without

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:08.500
a co-pay.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.900
We've extended the life of
Medicare by almost a decade.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.934
And I've proposed reforms that
will save Medicare money by

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:18.133
getting rid of wasteful spending
in the health care system and

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:20.333
reining in insurance
companies --

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:24.333
reforms that won't touch your
guaranteed Medicare benefits.

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:26.367
Not by a single dime.

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:29.800
Republicans in Congress have put
forward a very different plan.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.767
They want to turn Medicare
into a voucher program.

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:35.266
That means that instead of
being guaranteed Medicare,

00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:38.000
seniors would get a
voucher to buy insurance,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.266
but it wouldn't
keep up with costs.

00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:42.867
As a result, one plan would
force seniors to pay an extra

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:47.967
$6,400 a year for the same
benefits they get right now.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:51.600
And it would effectively
end Medicare as we know it.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.934
I think our seniors
deserve better.

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:56.400
I'm willing to work with anyone
to keep improving the current

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.533
system, but I refuse to do
anything that undermines the

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:02.300
basic idea of Medicare as
a guarantee for seniors

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.166
who get sick.

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:07.233
Here in America, we believe
in keeping our promises --

00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:10.233
especially to our seniors who
have put in a lifetime of hard

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:13.700
work and deserve to
enjoy their golden years.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.800
That's what Medicare
is all about.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.066
That's why we need to
strengthen and preserve it for

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:19.667
future generations.

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:22.734
And as long as I have the honor
of serving as your President,

00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:25.033
that's exactly what I'll do.

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:27.033
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
