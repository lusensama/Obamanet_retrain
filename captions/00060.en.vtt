The President:
Hi everybody.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.080
I'm talking with you today from
Ivy Tech Community College

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.150
in Indianapolis, where I just
held a town hall and heard

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.387
from everyday Americans about
what we can do, together,

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:22.856
to make their lives
a little better.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.958
This week, we got news that
confirms what we already

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:28.228
know -- that our businesses
continue to create jobs

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.264
for hardworking folks
all across the country.

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.266
Last month, America's
businesses added

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.870
another 267,000 jobs.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.274
In 2014, our economy created
more than 3.1 million jobs

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:43.610
in all -- the best
year for job growth

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.246
since the late 1990s.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.882
All told, over the
past 59 months,

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:53.953
the private sector has added
11.8 million new jobs-the

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.221
longest streak on record.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:59.592
And in the single most hopeful
sign for middle class families,

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:02.562
wages are rising again.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.398
America is poised for
another good year - as long

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:09.235
as Washington works to
keep this progress going.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.105
We have to choose -- will
we accept an economy where

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.574
only a few of us do
spectacularly well,

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:17.844
or will we build an economy
where everyone who works

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:19.913
hard can get ahead?

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.915
Because while we've
come a long way,

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.150
we've got more work to do to
make sure that our recovery

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.720
reaches more Americans,
not just those at the top.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.957
That's what middle-class
economics is all about --

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:34.027
the idea that this country
does best when everyone

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:36.029
gets their fair shot,
does their fair share,

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.866
and everyone plays by
the same set of rules.

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.235
This week, I sent
Congress a budget built

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:44.103
on middle-class economics.

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:46.773
It helps families afford
childcare, health care,

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:50.410
college, paid leave at
work, homeownership,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.346
and saving for retirement,
and it could put thousands

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.515
of dollars back into the
pockets of a working

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:57.317
family each year.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:00.453
It helps more Americans learn
new skills to earn higher wages,

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:02.822
including by making two
years of community college

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:07.193
free for responsible students
all across the country.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:09.362
It invests in the research
and infrastructure our

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:13.066
businesses need to compete
and create high-paying jobs.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:16.169
And it pays for this with smart
spending cuts and by fixing

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.105
a tax code that's riddled with
special-interest loopholes

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:22.075
for folks who don't need
them, allowing us to offer

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:26.513
tax breaks to students and
families who do need them.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:29.215
I believe this is where we need
to go to give working families

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:32.318
more security in a time of
constant economic change.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:35.421
And I'll work with
anyone-Republican or

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:39.359
Democrat-who wants to get
to "yes" on these issues.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.594
We won't agree on everything,
and that's natural --

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.997
but we should stop
refighting old battles,

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.966
and start working together
to help you succeed

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:48.935
in the new economy.

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:51.037
That's what you elected
us to do -- not

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:53.439
to turn everything into
another Washington food fight,

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.441
but to have debates
that are worthy

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:58.511
of this country, and to
build an economy not

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:01.447
just where everyone can
share in America's success,

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:05.552
but where everyone can
contribute to America's success.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:07.620
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
