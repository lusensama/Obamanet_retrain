00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.633
The President:
Here's the truth about today's
economy: If we're serious about

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:11.834
fighting for American jobs
and American businesses,

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:14.600
one of the most important things
we can do is open up more

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.767
markets to American
goods around the world.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:20.600
That's why I met with China's
President Hu Jintao at the White

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.367
House this past week.

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:26.700
We're now exporting more than
$100 billion a year to China in

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.500
goods and services.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.066
And as a result of deals
we completed this week,

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.633
we'll be increasing U.S.
exports to China by more than

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:38.066
$45 billion, and China's
investment in America by

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.000
several billion dollars.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.066
Most important, these deals will
support some 235,000 American jobs.

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.934
And that includes a lot
of manufacturing jobs.

00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:52.200
That goal is why I fought so
hard to negotiate a new and

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.667
better trade deal
with South Korea --

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:58.500
a deal with unprecedented
support from business and labor

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.100
-- that will support more
than 70,000 American jobs.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.000
And that's why I traveled to
India last fall to help pave the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.400
way for $10 billion in new deals
for American businesses and more

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.233
than 50,000 new American jobs.

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:14.533
Now, these may just
sound like statistics.

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.633
But yesterday, I saw what that
means firsthand when I traveled

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:20.800
to a GE plant in
Schenectady, New York.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.600
This plant is manufacturing
steam turbines and generators

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.633
for a big project in India
that resulted from a deal we

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:30.367
announced around that trip --
a project that is helping to

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:33.800
support more than 1,200
manufacturing jobs and more than

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.500
400 engineering
jobs in Schenectady.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.300
Good jobs at good wages, producing
American products for the world.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.633
At the same time, GE has also
been investing in innovation,

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:48.400
building a clean energy
center, an advanced battery

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.834
manufacturing plant, and other
state-of-the-art facilities in

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:55.734
Schenectady that are resulting
in hundreds of new American jobs

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:59.333
and contributing to America's
global economic leadership.

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.266
Leading the world in innovation.

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.667
Opening new markets
to American products.

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:05.734
That's how we'll
create jobs today.

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:08.700
That's how we'll make America
more competitive tomorrow.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.300
And that's how we're
going to win the future.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.367
Now, while I was in Schenectady,
I announced that Jeff Immelt,

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:17.800
GE's CEO and one of the most
imaginative and visionary

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.233
business leaders in America,
has agreed to head up our new

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:23.934
Council on Jobs and
Competitiveness.

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:26.900
The purpose of this council is
to help us find ways to grow our

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.967
economy by investing in our
businesses here at home.

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:34.000
And under Jeff's leadership, I'm
confident that they'll generate

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.066
good ideas about how
we can spur hiring,

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.900
educate our workers to
compete in the 21st century,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.367
and attract the best jobs and
businesses to America rather

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:46.734
than seeing them
spring up overseas.

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:48.867
We're living in a new
and challenging time,

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:52.300
in which technology has made
competition easier and fiercer

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.834
than ever before.

00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:56.567
Countries around the world are
upping their game and giving

00:02:56.567 --> 00:03:00.500
their workers and companies
every advantage possible.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.367
That shouldn't discourage us.

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:05.100
Because I know we can
win that competition.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.867
I know we can out-compete
any other nation on Earth.

00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:11.166
We just have to make sure we're
doing everything we can to

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:14.066
unlock the productivity
of American workers,

00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:16.767
unleash the ingenuity
of American businesses,

00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:20.467
and harness the dynamism
of America's economy.

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.633
Thanks everybody, and
have a great weekend.
