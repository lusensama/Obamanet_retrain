00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:08.734
The President:
This week, I spent some
time in Racine, Wisconsin,

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:11.033
talking with folks who are doing
their best to cope with the

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:14.000
aftermath of a brutal recession.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.500
And while I was there, a young
woman asked me a question I hear

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.667
all the time: "What are we doing
as a nation to bring jobs back

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:22.667
to this country?"

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:26.600
Well, on Friday, we learned that
after 22 straight months of job

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.900
loss, our economy has now
created jobs in the private

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.166
sector for six months in a row.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.967
That's a positive sign.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:37.934
But the truth is, the recession
from which we're emerging has

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:41.633
left us in a hole that's
about 8 million jobs deep.

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:43.767
And as I've said from
the day I took office,

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:47.567
it's going to take months, even
years, to dig our way out --

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:51.233
and it's going to require an
all-hands-on-deck effort.

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:53.567
In the short term, we're
fighting to speed up this

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:57.133
recovery and keep the economy
growing by all means possible.

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.800
That means extending
unemployment insurance for

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.033
workers who lost their job.

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:03.266
That means getting small
businesses the loans they need

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.700
to keep their doors open
and hire new workers.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.533
And that means sending relief to
states so they don't have to lay

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:14.133
off thousands of teachers
and firefighters and police officers.

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:17.333
Still, at a time when millions
of Americans feel a deep sense

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:21.066
of urgency in their own lives,
Republican leaders in Washington

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.800
just don't get it.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.300
While a majority of Senators
support taking these steps to

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.934
help the American people,
some are playing the same old

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:30.900
Washington games and using
their power to hold this relief

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.934
hostage -- a move that only ends up holding back our recovery.

00:01:34.934 --> 00:01:36.800
It doesn't make sense.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.033
But I promised those
folks in Wisconsin --

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:42.633
and I promise all of you
-- that we won't back down.

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:45.000
We're going to keep fighting
to advance our recovery.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.333
And we're going to keep
competing aggressively to make

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:50.567
sure the jobs and industries of
the future are taking root right

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:52.600
here in America.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.567
That's one of the reasons
why we're accelerating the

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:57.734
transition to a clean energy
economy and doubling our use of

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:01.500
renewable energy sources
like wind and solar power --

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.767
steps that have the potential to
create whole new industries and

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:08.033
hundreds of thousands
of new jobs in America.

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:10.700
In fact, today, I'm announcing
that the Department of Energy is

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.500
awarding nearly $2 billion in
conditional commitments to two

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.066
solar companies.

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:19.667
The first is Abengoa Solar, a
company that has agreed to build

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:22.333
one of the largest solar plants
in the world right here in the

00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:23.934
United States.

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:25.900
After years of watching
companies build things and

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.967
create jobs overseas, it's good
news that we've attracted a

00:02:28.967 --> 00:02:32.300
company to our shores to build a
plant and create jobs right here

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.834
in America.

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:37.400
In the short term, construction
will create approximately 1,600

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.266
jobs in Arizona.

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:43.066
What's more, over 70% of the
components and products used in

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:46.433
construction will be
manufactured in the U.S.A.,

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:50.767
boosting jobs and communities in
states up and down the supply chain.

00:02:50.767 --> 00:02:53.934
Once completed, this plant will
be the first large-scale solar

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:57.834
plant in the U.S. to actually store the energy it generates

00:02:57.834 --> 00:03:00.266
for later use -- even at night.

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:01.667
And it will generate
enough clean,

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:05.300
renewable energy to
power 70,000 homes.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.133
The second company is
Abound Solar Manufacturing,

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:11.800
which will manufacture advanced
solar panels at two new plants,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.433
creating more than 2,000 construction jobs and 1,500

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:17.100
permanent jobs.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.333
A Colorado plant is
already underway,

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:22.233
and an Indiana plant will be
built in what's now an empty

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:24.100
Chrysler factory.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.233
When fully operational, these
plants will produce millions of

00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:30.500
state-of-the-art solar
panels each year.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.233
These are just two of the many
clean energy investments in the

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:34.900
Recovery Act.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.533
Already, I've seen the payoff
from these investments.

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:39.567
I've seen once-shuttered
factories humming with new

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:43.233
workers who are building solar
panels and wind turbines;

00:03:43.233 --> 00:03:46.033
rolling up their sleeves to help
America win the race for the

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:48.200
clean energy economy.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.166
So that's some of
what we're doing.

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:53.233
But the truth is, steps like
these won't replace all the jobs

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.300
we've lost overnight.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.100
I know folks are struggling.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.533
I know this Fourth of July
weekend finds many Americans

00:03:59.533 --> 00:04:02.233
wishing things were a
bit easier right now.

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:03.734
I do too.

00:04:03.734 --> 00:04:06.800
But what this weekend reminds
us, more than any other,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.533
is that we are a nation that has
always risen to the challenges

00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:10.934
before it.

00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:14.033
We're a nation
that, 234 years ago,

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:16.867
declared our independence from
one of the greatest empires the

00:04:16.867 --> 00:04:18.500
world had ever known.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.700
We're a nation that mustered
a sense of common purpose to

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.767
overcome Depression
and fear itself.

00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:27.734
We're a nation that embraced a
call to greatness and saved the

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.633
world from tyranny.

00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:33.567
That's who we are -- a nation that turns times of trial into

00:04:33.567 --> 00:04:36.734
times of triumph -- and I know America will write our own

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:38.800
destiny once more.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.767
I wish every American a safe
and happy Fourth of July.

00:04:42.767 --> 00:04:44.834
And to all our troops
serving in harm's way,

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:48.600
I want you to know you have the
support of a grateful nation and

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.734
a proud Commander-in-Chief.

00:04:50.734 --> 00:04:54.467
Thank you, God bless you, and
God bless the United States of America.
