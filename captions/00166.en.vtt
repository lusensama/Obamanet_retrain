00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.066
The President:
On behalf of the Obama family
-- Michelle, Malia, Sasha,

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:13.500
Bo and me -- I want to
wish everyone a very

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.667
happy Thanksgiving.

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:18.533
For us, like so many of you,
this is a day full of family and

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.734
friends; food and football.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:25.066
It's a day to fight the
overwhelming urge to take a nap

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.400
-- at least until after dinner.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.867
But most of all, it's a time
to give thanks for each other,

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:34.834
and for the incredible bounty
we enjoy in this country.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.266
That's especially
important this year.

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.834
As a nation, we've just emerged
from a campaign season that was

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:44.033
passionate, noisy, and
vital to our democracy.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:46.533
But it also required
us to make choices --

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.300
and sometimes those choices
led us to focus on what sets us

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.300
apart instead of what
ties us together;

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.433
on what candidate we support
instead of what country we all

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:57.133
belong to.

00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:00.500
Thanksgiving is a chance to
put it all in perspective --

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.633
to remember that, despite
our differences, we are,

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:07.066
and always will be,
Americans first and foremost.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.633
Today we give thanks for
blessings that are all too rare

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.233
in this world.

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:14.266
The ability to spend time
with the ones we love;

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.567
to say what we want; to
worship as we please;

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:19.633
to know that there are brave men
and women defending our freedom

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:22.834
around the globe; and to look
our children in the eye and to

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:27.100
tell them that, here in America,
no dream is too big if they're

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.333
willing to work for it.

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.533
We're also grateful that this
country has always been home to

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.133
Americans who see these
blessings not simply as gifts to

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:37.567
enjoy, but as
opportunities to give back.

00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:40.433
Americans who believe we have a
responsibility to look out for

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:43.800
those who are less fortunate --
to pull each other up and move

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.967
forward together.

00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:49.800
Right now, as we prepare to
gather around our dinner tables,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.533
there are families in the
northeast who don't have

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.033
that luxury.

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:55.900
Many of them have lost
everything to Hurricane Sandy --

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.200
homes, possessions,
even loved ones.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.467
And it will be a long time
before life gets back to

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:03.300
normal for them.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.233
But in the midst
of so much tragedy,

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:07.700
there are also glimmers of hope.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.266
Over the last few weeks,
we've seen FEMA personnel,

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:13.500
National Guard and first
responders working around the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.967
clock in hard-hit communities.

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:18.333
We've seen hospital workers
using their lunch breaks to

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.166
distribute supplies.

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.667
Families offering
up extra bedrooms.

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:26.633
The fire department
advertising free hot showers.

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:30.266
Buses full of volunteers coming
from hundreds of miles away.

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:32.367
Neighbors sharing
whatever they have --

00:02:32.367 --> 00:02:36.834
food, water, electricity -- and
saying again and again how lucky

00:02:36.834 --> 00:02:39.734
they are to have a
roof over their heads.

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:42.233
It would have been easy for
these folks to do nothing --

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:45.834
to worry about themselves and
leave the rest to someone else.

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:47.567
But that's not who we are.

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.400
That's not what we do.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.300
As Americans, we are bold,
generous, big-hearted people.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.100
When our brothers and
sisters are in need,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.834
we roll up our sleeves
and get to work --

00:02:57.834 --> 00:02:59.600
not for the recognition
or the reward,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.266
but because it's the
right thing to do.

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:05.633
Because there but for
the grace of God go I.

00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:08.600
And because here in America,
we rise or fall together,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.500
as one nation and one people.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500
That's something to
be grateful for --

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.300
today and every day.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.367
So to all the Americans doing
your part to make our world a

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:22.633
better place -- it is my
great privilege to serve as

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:24.400
your President.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.300
To all our servicemembers
-- it is my honor to be

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.100
your Commander-in-Chief.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.934
And from our family to yours,
happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
