00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:13.100
The President:
This week, I've been traveling across our country to discuss

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.100
health insurance reform and to
hear directly from folks like

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.367
you -- your questions, your concerns, and your stories.

00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:24.433
Now, I know there's been a lot
of attention paid to some of the

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:27.033
town hall meetings that are
going on around the country --

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.200
especially those where
tempers have flared.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.567
You know how TV loves a ruckus.

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:35.433
But what you haven't seen -- because it's not as exciting --

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:37.633
are the many constructive
meetings going on all over the

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:41.100
country where Americans are
airing their hopes and concerns

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.700
about this very important issue.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.633
I've been holding
some of my own,

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:48.834
and the stories I've heard have
really underscored why I believe

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:51.433
so strongly that health
insurance reform is a challenge

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:53.533
we can't ignore.

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.433
They're stories like
Lori Hitchcock's,

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:57.600
who I met in New
Hampshire this week.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.400
Lori's got a
pre-existing condition,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.533
so no insurance
company will cover her.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.934
She's self-employed,
and in this economy,

00:01:03.934 --> 00:01:06.467
she can't find a job that
offers health care --

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:11.266
so she's been uninsured
for two years.

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.266
Or they're stories like Katie
Gibson's, who I met in Montana.

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:16.133
When Katie tried to change
insurance companies,

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.000
she was sure to list her
pre-existing conditions on the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.800
application and even called her
new company to confirm she'd

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.800
be covered.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.133
Two months later,
she was dropped --

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:29.734
after she'd already gone
off her other insurance.

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:31.667
These are stories that
aren't being told --

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:34.533
stories of a health care system
that works better for the

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.633
insurance industry than it
does for the American people.

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:41.033
And that's why we are going to
pass health insurance reform

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:45.600
that finally holds the
insurance companies accountable.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.066
But now's the hard part.

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:49.066
Because the history is clear -- every time we come close to

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:51.934
passing health insurance reform, the special interests with a

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:55.934
stake in the status quo use their influence and political

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:59.600
allies to scare and
mislead the American people.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.600
As an example, let's look at one
of the scarier-sounding and more

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.734
ridiculous rumors out there -- that so-called "death panels"

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:10.867
would decide whether senior citizens get to live or die.

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:14.000
That rumor began with the
distortion of one idea in a

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.467
Congressional bill that
would allow Medicare to cover

00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:19.667
voluntary visits with your
doctor to discuss your

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:23.734
end-of-life care -- if and
only if you decide to have

00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:24.333
those visits.

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:26.066
It had nothing to do with
putting government in control of

00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:29.633
your decisions; in fact,
it would give you all the

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:32.266
information you need
-- if you want it --

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:34.934
to put you in control
of your decisions.

00:02:34.934 --> 00:02:39.400
When a conservative Republican
Senator who supported this idea

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.800
-- in fact, had long-fought for even more far-reaching proposals

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.734
-- found out how folks
were twisting the idea,

00:02:44.734 --> 00:02:47.433
he called their misrepresentation --

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.133
and I quote -- "nuts."

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:52.967
So when folks with a stake in
the status quo keep inventing

00:02:52.967 --> 00:02:54.867
these boogeymen in an
effort to scare people,

00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:59.600
it's disappointing --
but it's not surprising.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.934
We've seen it before.

00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:02.200
When President Roosevelt
was working to create Social

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.800
Security, opponents warned it
would open the door to "federal

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.000
snooping" and force
Americans to wear dog tags.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.066
When President Kennedy and
President Johnson were working

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:15.533
to create Medicare, opponents
warned of "socialized medicine."

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:17.867
Sound familiar?

00:03:17.867 --> 00:03:21.333
Not only were those fears never
realized, but more importantly,

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:24.033
those programs have saved the
lives of tens of millions of

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:27.633
seniors, the disabled,
and the disadvantaged.

00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:30.767
Those who would stand in the
way of reform will say almost

00:03:30.767 --> 00:03:32.834
anything to scare you
about the cost of action.

00:03:32.834 --> 00:03:36.500
But they won't say much
about the cost of inaction.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.266
If you're worried about
rationed care, higher costs,

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:41.433
denied coverage, or bureaucrats
getting between you and your

00:03:41.433 --> 00:03:45.834
doctor, then you should
know that that's what's

00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:46.100
happening right now.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.767
In the past three years, over
12 million Americans were

00:03:48.767 --> 00:03:51.033
discriminated against by
insurance companies due to a

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:55.967
preexisting condition, or saw
their coverage denied or dropped

00:03:55.967 --> 00:03:58.834
just when they got sick
and needed it most.

00:03:58.834 --> 00:04:01.367
Americans whose jobs and health
care are secure today just don't

00:04:01.367 --> 00:04:05.500
know if they'll be next to join the 14,000 who lose their health

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.433
insurance every single day.

00:04:08.433 --> 00:04:11.567
And if we don't act, average
family premiums will keep rising

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:15.800
to more than $22,000
within a decade.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.166
On the other hand, here's what a reformed health care system will

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:20.333
mean for you.

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:21.867
First, no matter
what you've heard,

00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:24.533
if you like the doctor or the
health care plan you have,

00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:27.200
you can keep it.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.934
If you don't have insurance,
you'll finally be able to

00:04:29.934 --> 00:04:31.467
afford insurance.

00:04:31.467 --> 00:04:34.600
And everyone will have the
security and stability that's

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.700
missing today.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.133
Insurance companies will be
prohibited from denying you

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:40.367
coverage because of
your medical history,

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:42.800
dropping your coverage
if you get sick,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.600
or watering down your
coverage when it counts --

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.600
because there's no point in
having health insurance if it's

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.467
not there when you need it.

00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:51.633
Insurance companies will no
longer be able to place some

00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:54.600
arbitrary cap on the amount of
coverage you can receive in a

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.467
given year or a lifetime, and we
will place a limit on how much

00:04:59.467 --> 00:05:01.934
you can be charged for
out-of-pocket expenses --

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:04.200
because no one in America
should go broke just because

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.133
they get sick.

00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:10.400
Finally, we'll require insurance
companies to cover routine

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.333
checkups and preventive
care, like mammograms and

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:15.467
colonoscopies -- because there's no reason we shouldn't be saving

00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:19.667
lives and dollars by catching diseases like breast cancer and

00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:22.100
prostate cancer
on the front end.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.300
So that's what reform means.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.800
For all the chatter and
the noise out there,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.233
what every American needs to
know is this: If you don't have

00:05:29.233 --> 00:05:32.133
health insurance, you
will finally have quality,

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:34.367
affordable options
once we pass reform.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:38.433
If you do have health insurance,
we will make sure that no

00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:41.033
insurance company or government
bureaucrat gets between you and

00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:42.533
the care that you need.

00:05:42.533 --> 00:05:45.734
And we will deliver this in
a fiscally responsible way.

00:05:45.734 --> 00:05:48.734
Now, I know there's
plenty of real concern and

00:05:48.734 --> 00:05:50.100
skepticism out there.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.633
I know that in a time
of economic upheaval,

00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:55.266
the idea of change
can be unsettling,

00:05:55.266 --> 00:05:56.834
and I know that there are folks
who believe that government

00:05:56.834 --> 00:06:00.233
should have no role at all
in solving our problems.

00:06:00.233 --> 00:06:03.233
These are legitimate differences
worthy of the real discussion

00:06:03.233 --> 00:06:07.266
that America deserves -- one where we lower our voices,

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:10.567
listen to one another, and
talk about differences that

00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:11.633
really exist.

00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:13.367
Because while there may be
disagreements over how to go

00:06:13.367 --> 00:06:16.767
about it, there is widespread
agreement on the urgent need to

00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:21.200
reform a broken system
and finally hold insurance

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.967
companies accountable.

00:06:21.967 --> 00:06:27.066
Nearly 50 years ago, in the midst of the noisy early battles

00:06:27.066 --> 00:06:28.867
to create what would
become Medicare,

00:06:28.867 --> 00:06:32.800
President Kennedy said, "I
refuse to see us live on the

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.734
accomplishments of
another generation.

00:06:34.734 --> 00:06:36.266
I refuse to see this
country, and all of us,

00:06:36.266 --> 00:06:39.934
shrink from these struggles
which are our responsibility

00:06:39.934 --> 00:06:41.867
in our time."

00:06:41.867 --> 00:06:44.900
Now it falls to us to meet
the challenges of our time.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.934
And if we can come together,
and listen to one another;

00:06:48.934 --> 00:06:52.233
I believe, as I always have,
that we will rise to this

00:06:52.233 --> 00:06:54.967
moment, we will build something
better for our children,

00:06:54.967 --> 00:06:58.100
and we will secure America's
future in this new century.
