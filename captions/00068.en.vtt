00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.512
The President: On behalf
of the Obama family --

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:16.616
Michelle, Malia, Sasha,
Bo, and Sunny --

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.786
I want to wish you a
very happy Thanksgiving.

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.788
Like many of you, we'll
spend the day with

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.790
family and friends,
catching up, eating some

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.793
good food and watching
a little football.

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:29.329
Before we lift a fork,
we lend a hand by going

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.331
out in the community to
serve some of our

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.632
neighbors in need.

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:34.701
And we give thanks
for each other,

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:37.337
and for all of
God's blessings.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.339
Thanksgiving is my
favorite holiday because,

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.242
more than any other, it
is uniquely American.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.277
Each of us brings our own
traditions and cultures

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:47.113
and recipes to the table --
but we all share this day,

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:51.017
united by the gratitude for
the bounty of this nation.

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:54.154
And we welcome the
contributions of all people --

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:57.257
no matter their origin or
color or beliefs --

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.826
who call America home,
and who enrich the life

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:00.827
of our nation.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.530
It is a creed as old
as our founding:

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.168
"E pluribus unum" -- that
our of many, we are one.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.336
We are reminded that
this creed, and America

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.806
itself, was never
an inevitability,

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:15.275
but the result of ordinary
people in every generation

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:18.978
doing their part to uphold
our founding ideals --

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.980
by taking the
blessings of freedom,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.983
and multiplying them for
those who would follow.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.586
As President Kennedy once
wrote, even as we give

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.655
thanks for all that we've
inherited from those

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.225
who came before us --
"the decency of purpose,

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.928
steadfastness of resolve
and strength of will,

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.564
for the courage
and the humility,

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:40.467
which they possessed," we
must also remember that

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.570
"the highest appreciation
is not to utter words

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.738
but to live by them."

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:48.174
Today, we are grateful to all
Americans who do their part

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:50.577
to live by those ideals,
including our brave men

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:53.246
and women in uniform
overseas and their families,

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:56.416
who sacrifice so much
to keep America safe.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.885
To our service members
who are away from home,

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:01.254
we say an extra prayer for
you and your loved ones,

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:03.256
and we renew our
commitment to take care

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:05.258
of you as well as you've
taken care of us.

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:07.460
We are grateful to the
countless Americans who

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.964
serve their communities in
soup kitchens and shelters,

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.032
looking out for those
who are less fortunate,

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:16.436
and lifting up those who
have fallen on hard times.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:19.606
This generosity,
this compassion,

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:22.509
this belief that we are
each other's keepers,

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.611
is essential to who we
are, not just on this day,

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.813
but every day.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.815
It's easy to focus
on what separates us.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.985
But as we gather with loved
ones on this Thanksgiving,

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:35.655
let's remember and be grateful
for what binds us together.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.123
Our love of country.

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:40.026
Our commitment to
justice and equality.

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:42.629
Our belief that America's
best days are ahead,

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.164
and that her destiny
is ours to shape --

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:47.834
and that our
inherited ideals must

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.803
be the birthright of
all of our children.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.873
That's what today is all
about: that out of many,

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:54.874
we are one.

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:58.044
Thank you, God bless
you, and from my family

00:02:58.044 --> 00:02:59.646
to yours, Happy
Thanksgiving.
