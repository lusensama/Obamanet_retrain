00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.078
Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:14.681
On Tuesday, I gave my final
State of the Union Address.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:19.185
And a focus was this: how do
we make the new economy work

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.956
better for everyone, not
just those at the top?

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.225
After the worst economic
crisis of our lifetimes,

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.594
we're in the midst of
the longest streak of

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:30.830
private-sector job
growth in our history.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.533
More than 14
million new jobs.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.069
An unemployment
rate cut in half.

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.104
At the same time, our
economy continues to go

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.673
through profound changes
that began long before the

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.709
Great Recession hit.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.311
It's changed to the point
where even when folks have

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:47.313
jobs; even when the
economy is growing;

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.616
it's harder for hardworking
families to pull themselves

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:52.419
out of poverty, harder for
young people to start out on

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:55.321
their careers, and tougher
for workers to retire when

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.056
they want to.

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:59.492
That's a big part of the
reason a lot of working

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:00.827
families are
feeling anxious.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:04.164
And it offends our
fundamentally American

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:07.400
belief that everybody who
works hard should be able to

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.068
get ahead.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:11.204
That's why we've been
fighting so hard to give

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:14.874
families more opportunity
and more security - by

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:17.076
working to create
more good jobs,

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:20.480
invest in our middle class,
and help working people

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.215
get a raise.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:24.417
It's what the Affordable
Care Act is all about -

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:27.187
filling in the gaps in
employer-based care so that

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:30.223
when somebody loses a job,
or goes back to school,

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:34.360
or starts that new business,
they still have health care.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.896
And it's why I believe
we've got to take steps to

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:39.399
modernize our unemployment
insurance system.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.168
If a hardworking
American loses her job,

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:44.170
regardless of what
state she lives in,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.739
we should make sure she can
get unemployment insurance

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:49.742
and some help to retrain
for her next job.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.744
If she's been
unemployed for a while,

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:54.214
we should reach out to her
and connect her with

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:55.215
career counseling.

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:58.418
And if she finds a new job
that doesn't pay as much as

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:01.087
her old one, we should offer
some wage insurance that

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:03.623
helps her pay her bills.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.092
Under my plan, experienced
workers who now make less

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:10.363
than $50,000 could replace
half of their lost wages -

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:13.766
up to $10,000
over two years.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:16.569
It's a way to give families
some stability and encourage

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.905
folks to rejoin the
workforce - because we

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:21.107
shouldn't just be talking
about unemployment;

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:24.444
we should be talking
about re-employment.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:26.913
That's when America works
best - when everyone has

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:30.250
opportunity; when everyone
has some security;

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.952
and when everyone can
contribute to this country

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.220
we love.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.222
That's how we make sure that
hardworking families

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:37.223
can get ahead.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:39.592
And that's what I'll be
fighting for with every last

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.561
day of my presidency.

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:42.562
Thanks everybody.

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.564
Have a great weekend.
