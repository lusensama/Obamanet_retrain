00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.878
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:14.381
Nearly six years after the
worst financial crisis

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.383
of our lifetimes, our
businesses have

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:20.553
added nearly 10 million new jobs
over the past 53 months.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.622
That's the longest streak
of private-sector

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:24.224
job creation in our history.

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:27.026
And we're in a six-month
streak with our economy

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:30.430
creating at least 200,000
new jobs each month --

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.866
the first time that's
happened since 1997.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.002
Thanks to the decisions we
made to rescue

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.572
and rebuild our economy, and
your hard work and resilience,

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.374
America is leading again.

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:44.377
Areas like manufacturing,
energy, technology,

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.679
and autos are all booming.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.716
And here's the thing:
we're selling more goods

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.684
Made in America to the
rest of the world

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.353
than ever before.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.855
American exports are
at an all-time high.

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:58.925
Over the past five years,
we've worked hard

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:00.927
to open new markets for our
businesses,

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:03.530
and to help them compete on a
level playing field

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.631
in those markets.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.699
And we've broken records
for exports

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.568
four years running.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.570
Last year, our exports
supported more than

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.873
11 million American jobs -
about 1.6 million

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:16.109
more than when I took office.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.111
They're good jobs that
typically

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.613
pay about 15% more than the
national average.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.615
And more small businesses
are selling their goods

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.617
abroad than ever before --
nearly

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.187
300,000 last year alone.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.189
We should be doing
everything

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.859
we can to accelerate this
progress, not stall it.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.894
One place to start is
by supporting

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:35.895
something called

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.631
the U.S. Export-Import Bank.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.301
Its sole mission is to
create American jobs.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.469
That's it.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.704
It helps many American
entrepreneurs take that

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:47.874
next step and take their
small business global.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:50.743
But next month, its
charter will expire --

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.745
unless Members of
Congress do their

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:53.947
job and reauthorize it.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.283
Now, past Congresses have
done this 16 times,

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.819
always with support from
both parties.

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.821
Republican and Democratic
Presidents

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.423
have supported the bank, too.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:05.425
This time around shouldn't
be any different.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.193
Because the bank works.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:08.394
It's independent.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:10.163
It pays for itself.

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.565
But if Congress fails
to act, thousands

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.133
of businesses, large and
small,

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.135
that sell their products abroad
will take

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:18.104
a completely unnecessary hit.

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:21.274
Small business owners have
had to overcome

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:23.042
a lot these past several years.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:25.044
We all saw local
businesses close their

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:26.045
doors during the crisis.

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:28.114
And in the past few years,
we've seen more

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:30.750
and more open their doors and do
their part to help

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.919
lead America's comeback.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.255
At the very least, they
deserve a Congress

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.357
that doesn't stand in the
way of their success.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.094
Your members of Congress
are home this month.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.463
If you're a small business
owner or employee

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.598
of a large business that
depends on financing

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.401
to tackle new markets and
create new jobs,

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:50.870
tell them to quit treating your
business

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.273
like it's expendable, and start
treating

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:57.844
it for what it is: vital to
America's success.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.179
Tell them to do their jobs
-- keep America's

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.216
exports growing, and keep
America's recovery going.

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:06.386
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
