00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:12.834
The President:
I recently heard from a small business owner from New Jersey

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:15.633
who wrote that he employs eight
people and provides health

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:17.600
insurance for all of them.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.133
But his policy goes up at least
20% each year, and today,

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:24.700
it costs almost $1,400
per family per month --

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.934
his highest business expense
beside employees' salaries.

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:30.734
He's already had to
let two of them go,

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:34.667
and he may be forced to
eliminate health insurance altogether.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:38.567
He wrote, simply: "I'm not
looking for free health care,

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:41.734
I would just like to get my
premiums reduced enough to be

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:44.100
able to afford it."

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.367
Day after day, I hear from
people just like him.

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:49.600
Workers worried they may lose
their coverage if they become

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.266
too sick, or lose their
job, or change jobs.

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:56.233
Families who fear they may
not be able to get insurance,

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:58.533
or change insurance, if
someone in their family has a

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.767
pre-existing condition.

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:03.567
And small business owners trying
to make a living and do right by

00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:05.633
the people they employ.

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:08.400
These are the mom and pop
stores and restaurants,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.967
beauty shops and construction
companies that support families

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:13.834
and sustain communities.

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:15.834
They're the tiny
startups with big ideas,

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:19.667
hoping to become the next
Google or Apple or HP.

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:22.200
And, as shown in a new report
released today by the White

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.700
House Council of
Economic Advisers,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.967
right now they are getting
crushed by skyrocketing health care costs.

00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:32.000
Because they lack the bargaining
power that large businesses have

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.834
and face higher administrative
costs per person,

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:39.166
small businesses pay up to 18%
more for the very same health

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:43.166
insurance plans -- costs that eat into their profits and get

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.400
passed on to their employees.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.200
As a result, small businesses
are much less likely to offer

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.667
health insurance.

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:52.667
Those that do tend to
have less generous plans.

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:55.867
In a recent survey, one third
of small businesses reported

00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:57.333
cutting benefits.

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.633
Many have dropped
coverage altogether.

00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:03.533
And many have shed jobs, or
shut their doors entirely.

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:06.200
This is unsustainable,
it's unacceptable,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.000
and it's going to change when
I sign health insurance reform

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.600
into law.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.667
Under the reform
plans in Congress,

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:15.367
small businesses will be able
to purchase health insurance

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:18.867
through an "insurance exchange,"
a marketplace where they can

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:22.633
compare the price, quality and
services of a wide variety of

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:26.066
plans, many of which will
provide better coverage at lower

00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:28.834
costs than the
plans they have now.

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:33.633
They can then pick the one that
works best for them and their employees.

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:36.400
Small businesses that choose to
insure their employees will also

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.133
receive a tax credit to
help them pay for it.

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:43.200
If a small business chooses
not to provide coverage,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.300
its employees can
purchase high quality,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.500
affordable coverage through the
insurance exchange on their own.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.500
Low-income workers -- folks who are more likely to be working at

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.667
small businesses -- will qualify for a subsidy to help them cover the costs.

00:02:57.667 --> 00:02:59.667
And no matter how you
get your insurance,

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:02.266
insurance companies will no
longer be allowed to deny you

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:05.200
coverage because of a
pre-existing condition.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.533
They won't be able to drop your
coverage if you get too sick or

00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:09.734
lose your job or change jobs.

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:12.700
And we'll limit the amount your
insurance company can force you

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.767
to pay out of your own pocket.

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:18.700
To view the new report and learn
more about how health insurance

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.233
reform will help
small businesses,

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:25.533
go to whitehouse.gov, and send
us your questions and comments

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:29.100
-- we'll answer as many of
them as we can later this week.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.166
Over the past few months, I've
been pushing hard to make sure

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:35.800
we finally address the need
for health insurance reform,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.333
which has been deferred year
after year, decade after decade.

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:43.233
And today, after a lot
of hard work in Congress,

00:03:43.233 --> 00:03:47.066
we are closer than ever before
to finally passing reform that

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:49.900
will reduce costs,
expand coverage,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.967
and provide more choices for
our families and businesses.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:56.166
It's taken months
to reach this point,

00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:58.066
and once this
legislation passes,

00:03:58.066 --> 00:04:01.200
we'll need to move thoughtfully
and deliberately to implement

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.834
these reforms over a
period of several years.

00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:07.233
That's why I feel such a sense
of urgency about moving this

00:04:07.233 --> 00:04:09.000
process forward.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.200
Now I know there are those who
are urging us to delay reform.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.433
And some of them have actually
admitted that this is a tactic

00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:18.033
designed to stop
any reform at all.

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:21.100
Some have even suggested that,
regardless of its merits,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.900
health care reform should be
stopped as a way to inflict

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.066
political damage on
my Administration.

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:30.100
I'll leave it to them to explain
that to the American people.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.700
What I'm concerned about is the
damage that's being done right

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.300
now to the health
of our families,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.400
the success of our businesses,
and the long-term fiscal

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.767
stability of our government.

00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:44.066
I'm concerned about hard working
folks who want nothing more than

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:47.000
the security that comes with
knowing they can get the care

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.367
they need, when they need it.

00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:52.200
I'm concerned about the small
business owners who are asking

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.867
for nothing more than a chance
to seize their piece of the

00:04:54.867 --> 00:04:56.500
American Dream.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.200
I'm concerned about our children
and our grandchildren who will

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.000
be saddled with deficits that will continue piling up year

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.567
after year unless
we pass reform.

00:05:06.567 --> 00:05:09.300
This debate is not a political
game for these Americans,

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.567
and they cannot afford to
keep waiting for reform.

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:15.200
We owe it to them to
finally get it done --

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.367
and to get it done this year.

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:18.600
Thanks.
