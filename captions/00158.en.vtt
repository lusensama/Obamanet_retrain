00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:07.467
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:10.133
Here in America, we know the
free market is the greatest

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.233
force for economic progress
the world has ever known.

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:16.934
But we also know the free market
works best for everybody when we

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:19.767
have smart, common-sense
rules in place to prevent

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:21.934
irresponsible behavior.

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:25.400
That's why we passed tough
reforms to protect consumers and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.767
our financial system from the
kind of abuse that nearly

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:29.934
brought our economy
to its knees.

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:33.600
And that's why we've taken steps
to end taxpayer-funded bailouts,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
and make sure businesses and
individuals who do the right

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.000
thing aren't undermined
by those who don't.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But it's not enough
to change the law --

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.367
we also need cops on the
beat to enforce the law.

00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:49.066
And that's why, on Thursday, I
nominated Mary Jo White to lead

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.066
the Securities and
Exchange Commission,

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:54.233
and Richard Cordray to continue
leading the Consumer Financial

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:55.700
Protection Bureau.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.500
Mary Jo White has decades of
experience cracking down on

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.133
white-collar criminals and
bringing mobsters and terrorists

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.500
to justice.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.667
At the SEC, she will help
complete the task of reforming

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:09.000
Wall Street and keep going after
irresponsible behavior in the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.834
financial industry so that
taxpayers don't pay the price.

00:01:12.834 --> 00:01:16.000
Richard Cordray is a champion
for American consumers.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
After the Senate refused to
allow Richard an up-or-down vote

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.700
when I nominated him in 2011,
I took action to appoint him

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.000
on my own.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.734
And since then, he's helped
protect Americans from predatory

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:30.033
lenders, launched a "Know Before
You Owe" campaign to help

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:32.834
families make smart decisions
about paying for college,

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:35.467
and cracked down on credit
card companies that charge

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:36.967
hidden fees.

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:39.367
But Richard's appointment runs
out at the end of the year,

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:41.567
and in order for him
to stay on the job,

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:45.200
the Senate needs to finally
give him the vote he deserves.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.900
As President, my top
priority is simple:

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.767
To do everything in my power to
fight for middle-class families

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:53.500
and give every American the
tools they need to reach the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.967
middle class.

00:01:54.967 --> 00:01:57.667
That means bringing in people
like Mary Jo and Richard whose

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:00.200
job it is to stand up for you.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.166
It means encouraging businesses
to create more jobs and pay

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:06.400
higher wages, and improving
education and job training so

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.667
that more people can get the
skills that businesses are

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:10.033
looking for.

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:12.600
It means reforming our
immigration system and keeping

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.967
our children safe from the
menace of gun violence.

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:18.967
And it means bringing down our
deficit in a balanced way by

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:22.233
making necessary reforms and
asking every American to pay

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:24.467
their fair share.

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:27.000
I'm honored and humbled
to continue to serve as

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.133
your President.

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:31.133
And I am more hopeful than ever
that four years from now --

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:34.200
with your help -- this country
will be more prosperous,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.734
more open, and more committed
to the principles on which we

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:39.433
were founded.

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:41.433
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
