00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:08.834
The President:
Over the past 20 months, we've been fighting not just to create

00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:13.533
more jobs today, but to rebuild our economy on a stronger foundation.

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.934
Our future as a nation depends
on making sure that the jobs and

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:21.367
industries of the 21st century
take root here in America.

00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:24.433
And there is perhaps no industry
with more potential to create

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:27.800
jobs now -- and growth in the coming years --

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.867
than clean energy.

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:32.467
For decades, we've talked about
the importance of ending our

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:35.533
dependence on foreign oil and
pursuing new kinds of energy,

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:38.166
like wind and solar power.

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:41.767
But for just as long, progress
had been prevented at every turn

00:00:41.767 --> 00:00:45.367
by the special interests and
their allies in Washington.

00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:49.233
So, year after year, our
dependence on foreign oil grew.

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:53.367
Families have been held hostage
to spikes in gas prices.

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:56.033
Good manufacturing jobs have
gone overseas.

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:58.900
And we've seen companies produce
new energy technologies and

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.400
high-skilled jobs not in
America,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.033
but in countries like China,
India and Germany.

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:08.467
That's why it was essential -- for our economy, our security,

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:12.166
and our planet -- that we finally tackle this challenge.

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.867
That's why, since we took office,

00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:16.500
my administration has made a
historic commitment to promote

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.533
clean energy technology.

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.333
This will mean hundreds of
thousands of new American jobs

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.066
by 2012.

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:27.266
Jobs for contractors to install
energy-saving windows and insulation.

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.767
Jobs for factory workers to
build high-tech vehicle

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:33.533
batteries, electric cars, and
hybrid trucks.

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:36.066
Jobs for engineers and
construction crews to create

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:39.467
wind farms and solar plants that
are going to double the

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:42.533
renewable energy we can generate
in this country.

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:44.600
These are the jobs building the
future.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.367
For example, I want share with
you one new development,

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:51.133
made possible by the clean
energy incentives that we've launched.

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.233
This month, in the Mojave
Desert,

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:56.500
a company called BrightSource
plans to break ground on a

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.800
revolutionary new type of solar
power plant.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.834
It's going to put about a
thousand people to work building

00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:04.767
a state-of-the-art facility.

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:08.166
And when it's complete, it will
turn sunlight into the energy

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:11.867
that will power up to 140,000
homes --

00:02:11.867 --> 00:02:14.600
the largest such plant in the
world.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.000
Not in China.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.400
Not in India.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.533
But in California.

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:22.934
With projects like this one, and
others across this country,

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:26.233
we are staking our claim to
continued leadership in the new

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:27.934
global economy.

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:30.233
And we're putting Americans to
work producing clean,

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.400
home-grown American energy that
will help lower our reliance on

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.000
foreign oil and protect our
planet for future generations.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.367
Now, there are some in Washington who want to shut them down.

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:44.467
In fact, in the Pledge they
recently released,

00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:47.266
the Republican leadership is
promising to scrap all the

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:49.834
incentives for clean energy
projects,

00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:52.066
including those currently
underway --

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:55.567
even with all the jobs and
potential that they hold.

00:02:55.567 --> 00:02:58.033
This doesn't make sense for our
economy.

00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:01.533
It doesn't make sense for
Americans who are looking for jobs.

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:04.500
And it doesn't make sense for
our future.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.000
To go backwards and scrap these
plans means handing the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.333
competitive edge to China and
other nations.

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:14.867
It means that we'll grow even
more dependent on foreign oil.

00:03:14.867 --> 00:03:17.033
And, at a time of economic
hardship,

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:20.767
it means forgoing jobs we
desperately need.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:24.633
In fact, shutting down just this
one project would cost about a

00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:26.567
thousand jobs.

00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:28.734
That's what's at stake in this
debate.

00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:31.233
We can go back to the failed
energy policies that profited

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:34.033
the oil companies but weakened
our country.

00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:38.166
We can go back to the days when
promising industries got set up overseas.

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:41.734
Or we can go after new jobs in
growing industries.

00:03:41.734 --> 00:03:45.834
We can spur innovation and help make our economy more competitive.

00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:48.600
We know the choice that's right
for America.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.700
We need to do what we've always
done --

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.066
put our ingenuity and can do
spirit to work to fight for a

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:55.934
brighter future.

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:57.000
Thanks.
