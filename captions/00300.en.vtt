00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.967
MR. PRESIDENT: In this new
century, we live in a world that

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:10.767
has grown smaller and more
interconnected than at

00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:12.767
any time in history.

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.834
Threats to our nation's security
and economy can no longer be

00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:19.900
kept at bay by oceans or
by borders drawn on maps.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.400
The terrorists who struck our
country on 9/11 plotted in

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.400
Hamburg, trained in Kandahar and
Karachi, and threaten countries

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.633
across the globe.

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:32.166
Cars in Boston and Beijing are
melting ice caps in the Arctic

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.066
that disrupt weather
patterns everywhere.

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.734
The theft of nuclear material
from the former Soviet Union

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:42.367
could lead to the extermination
of any city on earth.

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:45.567
And reckless speculation by
bankers in New York and London

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:48.200
has fueled a global recession
that is inflicting pain on

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.033
workers and families around
the world and across America.

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:56.033
The challenges of our time
threaten the peace and

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:59.734
prosperity of every single
nation, and no one nation can

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:01.467
meet them alone.

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:03.900
That is why it is sometimes
necessary for a President to

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.834
travel abroad in order to
protect and strengthen our

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:08.967
nation here at home.

00:01:08.967 --> 00:01:10.734
That is what I have done this
week.

00:01:10.734 --> 00:01:14.033
I began my trip by attending a summit of the G20- the

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:17.600
countries that represent the
world's largest economies -

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.767
because we know that the
success of America's economy is

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:24.467
inextricably linked to
that of the global economy.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:27.333
If people in other countries
cannot spend, that means they

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.667
cannot buy the goods we produce
here in America, which means

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:34.200
more lost jobs and
more families hurting.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.734
Just yesterday, we learned that
we lost hundreds of thousands

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:40.400
more jobs last month, adding to
the millions we've lost since

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.300
this recession began.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.266
And if we continue to let banks
and other financial institutions

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:49.633
around the world act recklessly
and irresponsibly, that affects

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:52.867
institutions here at home as
credit dries up, and people

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:56.967
can't get loans to buy a home or
car, to run a small business or

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.300
pay for college.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.767
Ultimately, the only way out of
a recession that is global in

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:08.000
scope is with a response that
is global in coordination.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.233
That is why I'm pleased that
after two days of careful

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:13.834
negotiation, the G20 nations
have agreed on a series of

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:17.367
unprecedented steps that I
believe will be a turning point

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:21.133
in our pursuit of a
global economic recovery.

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:23.400
All of us are now moving
aggressively to get our banks

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.000
lending again.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.800
All of us are working to
spur growth and create jobs.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.133
And all of us have agreed on
the most sweeping reform of our

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:36.367
financial regulatory framework
in a generation - reform that

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:40.033
will help end the risky
speculation and market abuses

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:43.000
that have cost so
many people so much.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.166
I also met this past week with
the leaders of China and Russia,

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:49.266
working to forge constructive
relationships to address issues

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:52.533
of common concern, while being
frank with each other about

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:54.533
where we disagree.

00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:57.533
President Hu and I agreed that
the link between China's economy

00:02:57.533 --> 00:03:01.100
and ours is of great mutual
benefit, and we established a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.066
new Strategic and Economic
Dialogue between

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:06.400
the U.S. and China.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.467
President Medvedev and I
discussed our shared commitment

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:12.133
to a world without nuclear
weapons, and we signed a

00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:15.533
declaration putting America and
Russia on the path to a new

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:19.500
treaty to further reduce
our nuclear arsenals.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.767
Tomorrow, I will lay out
additional steps we must take to

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:26.900
secure the world's loose nuclear
materials and stop the spread of

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.567
these deadly weapons.

00:03:29.567 --> 00:03:32.700
Finally, I met yesterday with
our NATO allies and asked them

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.333
for additional civilian support
and assistance for our efforts

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:38.100
in Afghanistan.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.767
That is where al Qaeda trains,
plots, and threatens to launch

00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:43.600
their next attack.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.433
And that attack could occur in
any nation, which means that

00:03:46.433 --> 00:03:49.867
every nation has a stake in
ensuring that our mission in

00:03:49.867 --> 00:03:51.934
Afghanistan succeeds.

00:03:51.934 --> 00:03:54.100
As we have worked this week
to find common ground and

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.133
strengthen our alliances, we
have not solved all of our

00:03:57.133 --> 00:03:58.667
problems.

00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:01.433
And we have not agreed on every
point or every issue in every

00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:02.567
meeting.

00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:05.600
But we have made real and
unprecedented progress - and

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.467
will continue to do so in
the weeks and months ahead.

00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:12.500
Because in the end, we recognize
that no corner of the globe can

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.166
wall itself off from the threats
of the twenty-first century, or

00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:19.433
from the needs and
concerns of fellow nations.

00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:23.200
The only way forward is through
shared and persistent efforts to

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.767
combat fear and want
wherever they exist.

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:28.600
That is the challenge
of our time.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.400
And if we move forward with
courage and resolve, I am

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.100
confident that we will
meet this challenge.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.667
Thank you.
