00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.611
President Obama: Hi everybody.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.214
Wednesday is Earth Day,
a day to appreciate and

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.384
protect this precious
planet we call home.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:20.186
And today, there's no
greater threat to our planet

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.222
than climate change.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:26.659
2014 was the planet's
warmest year on record.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.963
Fourteen of the 15 hottest
years on record have all

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:34.200
fallen in the first 15
years of this century.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.636
This winter was cold in
parts of our country - as

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:39.639
some folks in Congress like
to point out - but around

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:43.042
the world, it was the
warmest ever recorded.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.044
And the fact that the
climate is changing has very

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:48.214
serious implications
for the way we live now.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.449
Stronger storms.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.117
Deeper droughts.

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:53.319
Longer wildfire seasons.

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.655
The world's top climate
scientists are warning us

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:58.057
that a changing climate
already affects the air our

00:00:58.057 --> 00:00:59.659
kids breathe.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.795
Last week, the Surgeon
General and I spoke with

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.464
public experts about how
climate change is already

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:07.333
affecting patients
across the country.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.502
The Pentagon says that
climate change poses

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:13.106
immediate risks to our
national security.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.275
And on Earth Day, I'm
going to visit the Florida

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.410
Everglades to talk about
the way that climate change

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.512
threatens our economy.

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.815
The Everglades is one of the
most special places in our

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:22.816
country.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:24.818
But it's also one
of the most fragile.

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:28.121
Rising sea levels are
putting a national treasure

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.990
- and an economic engine for
the South Florida tourism

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.560
industry - at risk.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.628
So climate change can no
longer be denied -

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.297
or ignored.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:39.799
The world is looking to the
United States - to us -

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:40.967
to lead.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:42.535
And that's what we're doing.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:45.171
We're using more clean
energy than ever before.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.173
America is number
one in wind power,

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.509
and every three weeks, we
bring online as much solar

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.146
power as we did
in all of 2008.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:55.148
We're taking steps
to waste less energy,

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.250
with more fuel-efficient
cars that save us money at

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.752
the pump, and more
energy-efficient buildings

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:02.655
that save us money on
our electricity bills.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.657
So thanks in part
to these actions,

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.093
our carbon pollution has
fallen by 10 percent since

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:10.830
2007, even as we've grown
our economy and seen the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.132
longest streak of
private-sector job growth

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:14.868
on record.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.403
We've committed to doubling
the pace at which we cut

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.405
carbon pollution, and
China has committed,

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:22.876
for the first time, to
limiting their emissions.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:25.445
And because the world's
two largest economies came

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.447
together, there's
new hope that,

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:29.482
with American
leadership, this year,

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:32.285
the world will finally reach
an agreement to prevent the

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:37.223
worst impacts of climate
change before it's too late.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:39.859
This is an issue that's
bigger and longer-lasting

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.728
than my presidency.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:44.597
It's about protecting our
God-given natural wonders,

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:46.866
and the good jobs
that rely on them.

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:49.235
It's about shielding our
cities and our families from

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.403
disaster and harm.

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:55.408
It's about keeping our
kids healthy and safe.

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:57.510
This is the only
planet we've got.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.512
And years from now, I want
to be able to look our

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:02.148
children and grandchildren
in the eye and tell them

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:06.085
that we did everything
we could to protect it.

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:09.489
Thanks everybody, and
have a great weekend.
