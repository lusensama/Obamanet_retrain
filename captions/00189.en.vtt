00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.266
The President:
This weekend, folks across the
country are opening up the pool,

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:13.400
firing up the grill, and taking
a well-earned moment to relax.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.967
But Memorial Day is more
than a three-day weekend.

00:00:16.967 --> 00:00:19.633
In town squares and
national cemeteries,

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:23.133
in public services and
moments of quiet reflection,

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.967
we will honor those who
loved their country enough to

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:28.834
sacrifice their
own lives for it.

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:32.633
This Memorial Day, Michelle and
I will join Gold Star families,

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:36.533
veterans, and their families
at Arlington National Cemetery.

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.900
We'll pay tribute to patriots
of every generation who gave the

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.000
last full measure of devotion,
from Lexington and Concord to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.700
Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.066
Later that day, we'll join
Vietnam veterans and their

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:54.600
families at the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial -- the Wall.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.967
We'll begin to mark the 50th
anniversary of the Vietnam War.

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:02.734
It's another chance to honor
those we lost at places like

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:07.934
Hue and Khe Sanh, Danang
and Hamburger Hill.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:11.300
And we'll be calling on you
-- the American people --

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.367
to join us in thanking
our Vietnam veterans in

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:16.133
your communities.

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:19.233
Even as we honor those who
made the ultimate sacrifice,

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:21.934
we reaffirm our commitment
to care for those who served

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:25.967
alongside them -- the
veterans who came home.

00:01:25.967 --> 00:01:27.834
This includes our newest
generation of veterans,

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:30.433
from Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:33.000
We have to serve them and their
families as well as they have

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.266
served us: By making sure that
they get the health care and

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:39.567
benefits they need; by caring
for our wounded warriors and

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:41.834
supporting our
military families;

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:44.467
and by giving veterans the
chance to go to college,

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:47.567
find a good job, and enjoy
the freedom that they risked

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:50.100
everything to protect.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.700
Our men and women in uniform
took an oath to defend our

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.633
country at all costs, and
today, as members of the finest

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:58.700
military the world
has ever known,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.600
they uphold that oath
with dignity and courage.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.300
As President, I have no higher
honor than serving as their

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.934
Commander-in-Chief.

00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:10.066
But with that honor comes
a solemn responsibility --

00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:13.400
one that gets driven home every
time I sign a condolence letter,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.166
or meet a family member
whose life has been turned

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:18.100
upside down.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.633
No words can ever bring back
a loved one who has been lost.

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:24.934
No ceremony can do
justice to their memory.

00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:28.500
No honor will ever
fill their absence.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.600
But on Memorial Day, we come
together as Americans to let

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.567
these families and veterans
know they are not alone.

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:38.433
We give thanks for those who
sacrificed everything so that we

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:39.867
could be free.

00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:42.467
And we commit ourselves to
upholding the ideals for which

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:45.934
so many patriots
have fought and died.

00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:49.100
Thank you, God bless you,
and have a wonderful weekend.
