00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.433
The President:
Hi everybody.

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:08.934
Right now,
the United States Senate

00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:11.367
is debating a bipartisan,
commonsense bill

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:12.800
that would be an important step

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.567
toward fixing our broken 
immigration system.

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:16.667
It's a bill
that would continue

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:18.900
to strengthen
security at our borders,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.600
and hold employers
more accountable

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.934
if they knowingly hire 
undocumented workers,

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:24.500
so they won't have
an unfair advantage

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.467
over businesses
that follow the law.

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:28.633
It's a bill
that would modernize

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:30.633
the legal immigration
system so that,

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:33.700
as we train American workers
for the jobs of tomorrow,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.367
we're also attracting
the highly skilled entrepreneurs

00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:40.333
and engineers who grow
our economy for everyone.

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.834
It's a bill that would
provide a pathway

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:44.400
to earned citizenship for
the 11 million individuals

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.633
who are in this
country illegally -

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:49.433
a pathway that includes
passing a background check,

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:53.066
learning English,
paying taxes and a penalty,

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.500
then going to the
back of the line

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.400
behind everyone trying
to come here legally.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.567
And, a few days ago,

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:01.166
a report from the Congressional
Budget Office definitively

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.734
showed that this bipartisan,
commonsense bill will help

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:07.066
the middle class grow our
economy and shrink our deficits,

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.066
by making sure that
every worker in America

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.600
plays by the same
set of rules

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.967
and pays taxes
like everyone else.

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:15.166
According to this
independent report,

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.233
reforming our immigration
system would reduce

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:19.667
our deficits by almost
a trillion dollars

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:21.266
over the next two decades.

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:24.633
And it will boost our economy
by more than 5 percent,

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:27.934
in part because of businesses
created, investments made,

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:31.200
and technologies
invented by immigrants.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.333
This comes on the heels
of another report

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.333
from the independent office

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.734
that monitors
Social Security's finances,

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:38.367
which says that
this immigration bill

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:41.967
would actually strengthen 
the long-term health and solvency

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:45.166
of Social Security
for future generations.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.834
Because with this bill,
millions of additional people

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:50.467
will start paying more
in taxes for things

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.800
like Social Security
and education.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.500
That'll make the economy fairer
for middle-class families.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.333
So that's what comprehensive
immigration reform looks like.

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:00.767
Stronger enforcement.

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:02.867
A smarter legal
immigration system.

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:05.400
A pathway to
earned citizenship.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.867
A more vibrant, growing
economy that's fairer

00:02:07.867 --> 00:02:09.233
on the middle class.

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:12.467
And a more stable fiscal
future for our kids.

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:14.100
Now, the bill isn't perfect.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.233
It's a compromise.

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:17.333
Nobody is going to get
everything they want -

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:20.467
not Democrats,
not Republicans, not me.

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:21.967
But it's consistent
with the principles

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:25.266
that I and others have laid out
for commonsense reform.

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:27.433
That's why Republicans
and Democrats,

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:29.266
CEOs and labor leaders,

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:32.600
are saying that now is
the time to pass this bill.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.000
If you agree with us,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.800
reach out to your Senators
and Representatives.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.767
Tell them that the time
for excuses is over;

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:42.266
it's time to fix our
broken immigration system

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:44.300
once and for all.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.200
We can do this, because
we are a nation of laws

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.967
and a nation of immigrants;

00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:51.266
a place enriched by 
the contributions of people

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:54.433
from all over the world,
and stronger for it.

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:57.100
That's been the story of
America from the start.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.000
Let's keep it going.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.934
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
