00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.478
The President: This week, I
authorized

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.847
two operations in Iraq.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.216
First, I directed our
military to take action

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.485
to protect our American
diplomats and military

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.854
advisors serving in
the city of Erbil.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:24.858
In recent days, terrorist
forces neared the city.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.860
Thursday night, I made
it clear that if they

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.362
attempted to advance
further, our military

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.798
would respond with
targeted strikes.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:32.799
That's what we've done.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.801
And, if necessary, that's
what we will

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.336
continue to do.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.338
We have Americans serving
across Iraq,

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:41.174
including our embassy in
Baghdad, and we'll do whatever

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:43.176
is needed to protect
our people.

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:45.211
Second, we've begun a
humanitarian effort

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.782
to help those Iraqi civilians
trapped on that mountain.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.784
The terrorists that have
taken over parts

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.786
of Iraq have been especially
brutal to religious

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:56.656
minorities-rounding up
families, executing men,

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:59.292
enslaving women, and
threatening the systematic

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:02.028
destruction of an entire
religious community,

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:03.029
which would be genocide.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.733
The thousands-perhaps tens
of thousands-of Iraqi

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.736
men, women and children who
fled to that mountain

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.105
were starving and
dying of thirst.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.107
The food and water we
airdropped

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.208
will help them survive.

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.210
I've also approved
targeted American

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.212
airstrikes to help Iraqi
forces break

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:22.415
the siege and rescue these families.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.784
Earlier this week, one
anguished Iraqi

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.920
in this area cried to the world,
"There is no one

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.655
coming to help."

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.356
Today, America is helping.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:33.026
The United States cannot
and should

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.795
not intervene every time there's
a crisis in the world.

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:37.764
But when there's a
situation like

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:40.233
the one on this mountain-when
countless innocent people

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.802
are facing a massacre, and
when we have

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:45.338
the ability to help prevent
it-the United States

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:47.307
can't just look away.

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:49.008
That's not who we are.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.109
We're Americans.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.110
We act.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.111
We lead.

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:54.747
And that's what we're
going to do on that mountain.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.783
As one American who wrote
to me yesterday said,

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:57.884
"it is the right thing to do."

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.587
As Commander-in-Chief, I
will not allow

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.655
the United States to be dragged
into fighting another

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.290
war in Iraq.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.292
American combat troops
will not be returning

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.294
to fight in Iraq, because
there's

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.964
no American military solution to
the larger crisis there.

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.666
What we will do is
continue

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.368
our broader strategy in Iraq.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:18.071
We will protect
our citizens.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.073
We will work with the
international

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:22.876
community to address this
humanitarian crisis.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.878
We'll help prevent these
terrorists from having

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:28.281
a permanent safe haven from
which to attack America.

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:30.583
And we'll continue to
urge Iraqi communities

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:33.853
to reconcile, come together
and fight back against

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:35.989
these terrorists so the
people of Iraq

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.125
have the opportunity for a
better future-the opportunity

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:42.395
for which so many Americans
gave their lives in Iraq

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:43.496
in a long and hard war.

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:46.699
Today, we salute our
brave men and women

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.701
in uniform-especially our
courageous pilots

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.870
and crews over Iraq.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.972
They're protecting
our fellow Americans.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.974
They're helping save the
lives of innocent

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:58.111
people on a mountain-people who
today know that there's

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.113
a country called America
that cares for them,

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:02.482
too, and that is willing to
stand up-not just

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:05.084
for our own security, but for
the dignity and freedom

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:06.319
that belongs to all people.
