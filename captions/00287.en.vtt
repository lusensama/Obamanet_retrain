00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:14.331
President Obama:
It has now been more than a week since the

00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:19.541
attempted act of terrorism aboard that flight
to Detroit on Christmas Day. On Thursday,

00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:23.431
I received the preliminary findings of the
reviews that I ordered into our terrorist

00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:28.351
watchlist system and air travel screening.
I've directed my counterterrorism and homeland

00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:32.731
security advisor at the White House, John
Brennan, to lead these reviews going forward

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:37.891
and to present the final results and recommendations
to me in the days to come. As I said this

00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:42.651
week, I will do everything in my power to
make sure our hard-working men and women in

00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:47.731
our intelligence, law enforcement and homeland
security communities have the tools and resources

00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:52.751
they need to keep America safe. This includes
making sure these communities, and the people

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:57.251
in them, are coordinating effectively and
are held accountable at every level. And as

00:00:57.251 --> 00:01:02.001
President, that is what I will do. Meanwhile,
the investigation into the Christmas Day incident

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:06.471
continues, and we're learning more about
the suspect. We know that he traveled to Yemen,

00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:11.141
a country grappling with crushing poverty
and deadly insurgencies. It appears that he

00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:16.521
joined an affiliate of al Qaeda, and that
this group, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, trained

00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:20.881
him, equipped him with those explosives and
directed him to attack that plane headed for

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:26.001
America. This is not the first time this group
has targeted us. In recent years, they have

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:31.381
bombed Yemeni government facilities and Western
hotels, restaurants and embassies; including

00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:36.291
our embassy in 2008, killing one American.
So, as President, I've made it a priority

00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:40.080
to strengthen our partnership with the Yemeni
government -- training and equipping their

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.741
security forces, sharing intelligence and
working with them to strike al Qaeda terrorists.

00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:50.161
And even before Christmas Day, we had seen
the results. Training camps have been struck;

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:55.241
leaders eliminated; plots disrupted. And all
those involved in the attempted act of terrorism

00:01:55.241 --> 00:02:00.571
on Christmas must know -- you too will be held
to account. But these efforts are only part

00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:05.671
of a wider cause. It's been nearly a year
since I stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol

00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:10.411
and took the oath of office as your President.
And with that oath came the solemn responsibility

00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:15.571
that I carry with me every moment of every
day, the responsibility to protect the safety

00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:20.591
and security of the American people. On that
day I also made it very clear, our nation

00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:25.591
is at war against a far-reaching network of
violence and hatred, and that we will do whatever

00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:30.821
it takes to defeat them and defend our country,
even as we uphold the values that have always

00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:35.601
distinguished America among nations. And make
no mistake, that's exactly what we've

00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:41.170
been doing. It's why I refocused the fight, bringing
to a responsible end the war in Iraq, which

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.461
had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, and
dramatically increasing our resources in the

00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:50.981
region where al Qaeda is actually based, in
Afghanistan and Pakistan. It's why I've

00:02:50.981 --> 00:02:56.810
set a clear and achievable mission to disrupt,
dismantle and defeat al Qaeda and its extremist

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.271
allies and prevent their return to either
country. And it's why we've forged new

00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:06.241
partnerships, as in Yemen, and put unrelenting
pressure on these extremists wherever they

00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:12.170
plot and train, from East Africa to Southeast
Asia, from Europe to the Persian Gulf. And

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.840
though often out of sight, our progress has
been unmistakable. Along with our partners,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.001
we've disrupted terrorist financing, cut
off recruiting chains, inflicted major losses

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:27.151
on al Qaeda's leadership, thwarted plots here
in the United States, and saved countless

00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:32.391
American lives. Yet as the Christmas Day attempt
illustrates, and as we were reminded this

00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:38.291
week by the sacrifices of more brave Americans
in Afghanistanâ€”including those seven dedicated

00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:43.711
men and women of the CIA, the hard work of
protecting our nation is never done. So as

00:03:43.711 --> 00:03:48.780
our reviews continue, let us ask the questions
that need to be asked. Let us make the changes

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.090
that need to be made. Let us debate the best
way to protect the country we all love. That

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.761
is the right and responsibility of every American
and every elected official. But as we go forward,

00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:04.541
let us remember this, our adversaries are
those who would attack our country, not our

00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:09.801
fellow Americans, not each other. Let's
never forget what has always carried us through

00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:15.861
times of trial, including those attacks eight
Septembers ago. Instead of giving in to fear

00:04:15.861 --> 00:04:21.600
and cynicism, let's renew that timeless
American spirit of resolve and confidence

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.391
and optimism. Instead of succumbing to partisanship
and division, let's summon the unity that

00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:32.560
this moment demands. Let's work together,
with a seriousness of purpose, to do what

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.780
must be done to keep our country safe. As
we begin this New Year, I cannot imagine a

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.020
more fitting resolution to guide us-as a
people and as a nation. Happy New Year.
