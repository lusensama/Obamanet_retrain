00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.678
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.013
Everything we've done over
the past six years has been

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:17.517
in pursuit of one
overarching goal: creating

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.653
opportunity for all.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.589
What we've long understood,
though, is that some

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.958
communities have
consistently had the odds

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.793
stacked against them.

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.428
That's true of rural
communities with

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:29.996
chronic poverty.

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:32.332
That's true of some
manufacturing communities

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.567
that suffered after the
plants they depended on

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.369
closed their doors.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:39.472
It's true of some suburbs
and inner cities, where jobs

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:42.742
can be hard to find
and harder to get to.

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:46.413
That sense of unfairness and
powerlessness has helped to

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.815
fuel the kind of unrest that
we've seen in places like

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:52.719
Baltimore, Ferguson,
and New York.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.656
It has many causes -- from a
basic lack of opportunity to

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:59.659
groups feeling unfairly
targeted by police - which

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.495
means there's no
single solution.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.532
But there are many that
could make a different and

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:06.866
could help.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.835
And we have to do everything
in our power to make this

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:12.138
country's promise real for
everyone willing to work

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:13.873
for it.

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:16.409
That's why last Tuesday,
at a summit organized by

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.546
Catholics and evangelicals,
I sat down with a

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.382
conservative scholar and
a poverty expert for a

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.884
discussion on what it takes
to open more doors

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:26.386
of opportunity.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:30.857
We know our efforts matter:
since 1967, we've brought

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:34.561
poverty down by about 40
percent, thanks in part to

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:37.030
programs like Social
Security and the Earned

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.933
Income Tax Credit for
working families.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.669
And we know that there are
folks from all faiths, and

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:46.306
across the ideological
spectrum, who care deeply

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.007
about "the least of these."

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.144
So I hope this conversation
continues, not as a question

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.746
of whether, but of how, we
can work together to

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.715
grow opportunity.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:59.052
Because it's not words,
but deeds, that make

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:00.587
a difference.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:03.556
And from expanding tax cuts
for working parents, to

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:06.125
raising high school
graduation rates, to helping

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:09.729
millions of Americans secure
health insurance when they

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.899
didn't have it just a few
years ago -- our actions are

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:14.601
making a difference.

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.169
Of course, lack of
opportunity is not the only

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.338
barrier between too many of
our young people and the

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:20.240
kind of future they deserve.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.176
On Monday, I'll travel to
Camden, New Jersey, a city

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.645
that has faced one of the
highest violent crime rates

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:26.980
in America.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.749
I'll highlight some of the
innovative things they've

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.919
done to help police do their
jobs more safely and reduce

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.387
crime in the process.

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:37.790
And I'll highlight steps all
cities can take to maintain

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.460
trust between the brave law
enforcement officers who put

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.996
their lives on the line,
and the communities they're

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:47.000
sworn to serve and protect.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.801
Whether we are Democrats,
Republicans, or

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.771
independents; whether we
live in one of our poorest

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:53.907
communities, one of our
wealthiest, or anywhere in

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:57.076
between, we all want our
country to be one where hard

00:02:57.076 --> 00:03:01.548
work pays off and
responsibility is rewarded.

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:05.985
We want a place where you
can make it if you try.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.187
That's the promise we
make to our young people.

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:10.189
That's the promise that
makes us exceptional.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.091
And it's the promise I'll
never stop fighting to keep,

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:15.695
for my children
and for yours.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.764
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
