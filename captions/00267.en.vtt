00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:08.266
The President:
After a decade of hardship for middle class families,

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.967
and a recession that wiped away
millions of jobs,

00:00:10.967 --> 00:00:13.633
we're in the middle of a tough
fight to rebuild this economy

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:15.734
and put folks back to work.

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:18.734
Winning this fight will not
depend on government alone.

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:22.033
It'll depend on the innovation
of American entrepreneurs;

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:24.767
on the drive of American small
business owners;

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:28.300
on the skills and talents of
American workers.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.734
These are the people who will
help us grow our economy and

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:32.400
create jobs.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.433
But government still has an
important responsibility.

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:37.867
And that's to create an
environment in which someone can

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:40.567
raise capital to start a new
company;

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:43.033
where a business can get a loan
to expand;

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:47.734
where ingenuity is prized and
folks are rewarded for their hard work.

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:50.800
That's why I fought so hard to
pass a jobs bill to cut taxes

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.967
and make more loans available
for entrepreneurs.

00:00:53.967 --> 00:00:57.100
It eliminated the capital gains
taxes for key investments in

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.533
small businesses.

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:02.233
It increased the deduction to
defray the costs of starting a company.

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:04.934
And it's freeing up credit for
folks who need it.

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:08.533
In fact, in just the first two
weeks since I signed the bill,

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:11.567
thousands of business owners
have been able to get new loans

00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:13.300
through the SBA.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.934
But we need to do more.

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:17.500
So I've proposed additional
steps to grow the economy and

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.000
spur hiring by businesses across
America.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.066
Now, one of the keys to job
creation is to encourage

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:26.200
companies to invest more in the
United States.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.400
But for years, our tax code has
actually given billions of

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.233
dollars in tax breaks that
encourage companies to create

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:35.000
jobs and profits in other
countries.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.500
I want to close these tax
loopholes.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.567
Instead, I want to give every
business in America a tax break

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:45.000
so they can write off the cost
of all new equipment they buy next year.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.667
That's going to make it easier
for folks to expand and hire new people.

00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:52.600
I also want to make the research and experimentation tax credit permanent.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.600
Because promoting new ideas and
technologies is how we'll create

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.367
jobs and retain our edge as the
world's engine of discovery and innovation.

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:03.934
And I want to provide a tax cut
for clean energy manufacturing

00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:05.734
right here in America.

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:09.533
Because that's how we'll lead
the world in this growing industry.

00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:11.600
These are commonsense ideas.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.633
When more things are made in
America,

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.767
more families make it in
America;

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:18.367
more jobs are created in
America;

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:21.133
more businesses thrive in
America.

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:23.834
But Republicans in Washington
have consistently fought to keep

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:26.500
these corporate loopholes open.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.900
Over the last four years alone,
Republicans in the House voted

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.000
11 times to continue rewarding
corporations that create jobs

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.567
and profits overseas -- a policy that costs taxpayers billions of

00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:40.533
dollars every year.

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:42.200
That doesn't make a lot sense.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.100
It doesn't make sense for
American workers,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.066
American businesses, or
America's economy.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:49.500
A lot of companies that do
business internationally make an

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.166
important contribution to our
economy here at home.

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:53.633
That's a good thing.

00:02:53.633 --> 00:02:56.300
But there's no reason why our tax code should actively reward

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.800
them for creating jobs overseas.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.934
Instead, we should be using our
tax dollars to reward companies

00:03:01.934 --> 00:03:05.367
that create jobs and businesses
within our borders.

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:09.667
We should give tax breaks to
American small businesses and manufacturers.

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.100
We should reward the people who
are helping us lead in the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.567
industries of the future, like
clean energy.

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:17.233
That's how we'll ensure that
American innovation and

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:20.333
ingenuity are what drive the
next century.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:24.133
That's how we'll put our people
back to work and lead the global economy.

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:27.467
And that's what I'll be fighting
for in the coming months.

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:28.500
Thanks.
