00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.000
The President:
On Tuesday, in my State
of the Union Address,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.133
I laid out a blueprint for
an economy built to last --

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:15.400
an economy built on American
manufacturing, American energy,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.400
skills for American workers, and
a renewal of American values.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.734
This week, I took that
blueprint across the country,

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:25.533
and what I saw was people
who work hard and believe in

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.800
each other.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.567
They believe in the America
that's within our reach.

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:31.600
But they're not sure that the
right thing will get done in

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.900
Washington this year, or next
year, or the year after that.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.100
And frankly, when you look at
some of the things that go on in

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.767
this town, who could blame them
for being a little cynical?

00:00:41.767 --> 00:00:45.400
Just two days ago, a senator
promised to obstruct every

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.667
single American I appoint to a
judgeship or a public service

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:52.800
position -- unless I fire the
consumer watchdog I put in place

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.567
to protect the American
people from financial schemes

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:57.333
or malpractice.

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.600
For the most part, it's not
that this senator thinks these

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.700
nominees are unqualified.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.800
In fact, all of the judicial
nominees being blocked have

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.567
bipartisan support.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.500
And almost 90% have
unanimous support from the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.300
Judiciary Committee.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.133
Instead, one of the senator's
aides told reporters that the

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.400
senator plans to,
and I'm quoting here,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.633
"delay and slow the
process in order to get the

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:23.567
President's attention."

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:26.300
Well, this isn't about me.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.533
We weren't sent here to wage
perpetual political campaigns

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.967
against each other.

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:33.700
We were sent here to
serve the American people.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.433
And they deserve better
than gridlock and games.

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:41.533
One senator gumming up the whole
works for the entire country is

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:45.200
certainly not what our
founding fathers envisioned.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.433
The truth is, neither
party has been blameless in

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:48.433
tactics like these.

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:51.900
But it's time for both
parties to put an end to them.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.166
I'm asking Congress, both
Democrats and Republicans,

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:59.066
to stop this kind of behavior by
passing a rule that allows all

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:02.767
judicial and public service
nominations a simple up-or-down

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:05.734
vote within 90 days.

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:07.667
We should also stem the
corrosive influence of money

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:09.066
in politics.

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:11.467
The House and Senate should
send me a bill that bans insider

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:15.333
trading by Members of Congress,
and I will sign it immediately.

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:18.367
They should limit any elected
official from owning stocks in

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:20.367
industries they impact.

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:22.633
And they should make sure
people who bundle campaign

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:27.667
contributions for Congress can't
lobby Congress, and vice versa.

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:29.333
During my Address
on Tuesday night,

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:32.400
I spoke about the incredible
example set by the men and women

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.200
of our armed forces.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.567
At a time when too many of our
institutions have let us down,

00:02:37.567 --> 00:02:40.233
they exceed all expectations.

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:42.500
They're not consumed
with personal ambition.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.934
They don't obsess over
their differences.

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:47.200
They focus on the
mission at hand.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.200
They work together.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.600
If you agree with me that
leaders in Washington should

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.900
follow their example, then
make your voice heard.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.467
Tell your Member of Congress
that it's time to end the

00:02:57.467 --> 00:03:00.900
gridlock, and start tackling
the issues that really matter --

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.700
an economy built on American
manufacturing, American energy,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.400
American skills and education,
and a return to American values.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.133
An economy built to last.

00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:13.166
Thanks.

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:14.900
God bless you, and
have a great weekend.
