00:00:08.494 --> 00:00:10.027
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.027 --> 00:00:12.628
Our top priority as a nation,
and my top priority as

00:00:12.628 --> 00:00:15.928
President, must be doing
everything we can to re-ignite

00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:20.928
the engine of America's growth:
a rising, thriving middle class.

00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:22.261
That's our North Star.

00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:25.194
That must drive every
decision that we make.

00:00:25.194 --> 00:00:28.461
Now, yesterday, we learned that
our businesses created 95,000

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.428
new jobs last month.

00:00:30.428 --> 00:00:33.261
That's about 500,000
new jobs this year,

00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:37.127
and nearly 6.5 million new jobs
over the past three years.

00:00:37.127 --> 00:00:41.061
But we've got more to do to
get the economy growing faster,

00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:44.594
so that everybody who
wants a job can find one.

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:47.194
And that means we need fewer
self-inflicted wounds from

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:49.928
Washington, like the
across-the-board spending cuts

00:00:49.928 --> 00:00:51.994
that are already hurting
many communities --

00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:54.861
cuts that economists predict
will cost our economy hundreds

00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:57.695
of thousands of jobs this year.

00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:00.528
If we want to keep rebuilding
this economy on a stronger,

00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:03.828
sturdier foundation for growth
-- growth that creates good,

00:01:03.828 --> 00:01:08.795
middle-class jobs -- we
have to make smarter choices.

00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:11.594
This week, I'll send a budget to
Congress that will help do just

00:01:11.594 --> 00:01:15.328
that -- a fiscally-responsible
blueprint for middle-class

00:01:15.328 --> 00:01:17.294
jobs and growth.

00:01:17.294 --> 00:01:20.127
For years, an argument in
Washington has raged between

00:01:20.127 --> 00:01:22.227
reducing our deficits
at all costs,

00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:25.361
and making the investments
we need to grow the economy.

00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:27.661
My budget puts that
argument to rest.

00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:29.961
Because we don't have to
choose between these goals --

00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:31.695
we can do both.

00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:34.127
After all, as we
saw in the 1990s,

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:38.227
nothing reduces deficits
faster than a growing economy.

00:01:38.227 --> 00:01:41.061
My budget will reduce our
deficits not with aimless,

00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:43.661
reckless spending cuts that
hurt students and seniors and

00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:46.895
middle-class families -- but
through the balanced approach

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:50.161
that the American people prefer,
and the investments that a

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:52.461
growing economy demands.

00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:55.194
Now, the truth is, our deficits
are already shrinking.

00:01:55.194 --> 00:01:56.194
That's a fact.

00:01:56.194 --> 00:01:59.994
I've already signed more than
$2.5 trillion in deficit

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:03.528
reduction into law, and my
budget will reduce our deficits

00:02:03.528 --> 00:02:07.828
by nearly $2 trillion more,
without harming the recovery.

00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:11.361
That surpasses the goal of $4
trillion in deficit reduction

00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:15.094
that many economists believe
will stabilize our finances.

00:02:15.094 --> 00:02:17.861
We'll make the tough reforms
required to strengthen Medicare

00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:20.928
for the future, without
undermining the rock-solid

00:02:20.928 --> 00:02:22.994
guarantee at its core.

00:02:22.994 --> 00:02:26.628
And we'll enact commonsense tax
reform that includes closing

00:02:26.628 --> 00:02:29.728
wasteful tax loopholes for the
wealthy and well-connected --

00:02:29.728 --> 00:02:32.695
loopholes like the ones that
allow a billionaire to pay a

00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:35.428
lower tax rate than
his or her secretary.

00:02:35.428 --> 00:02:37.695
This is the compromise I offered
the Speaker of the House at the

00:02:37.695 --> 00:02:39.328
end of last year.

00:02:39.328 --> 00:02:42.628
While it's not my ideal plan
to further reduce the deficit,

00:02:42.628 --> 00:02:45.828
it's a compromise I'm willing to
accept in order to move beyond a

00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:48.795
cycle of short-term,
crisis-driven decision-making,

00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:52.094
and so that we can focus on
growing our economy and our

00:02:52.094 --> 00:02:54.461
middle class for the long run.

00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:56.594
It includes ideas many
Republicans have said they could

00:02:56.594 --> 00:02:58.227
accept as well.

00:02:58.227 --> 00:03:01.328
It's a way we can make
progress together.

00:03:01.328 --> 00:03:04.895
But deficit reduction cannot
come at the cost of economic

00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:07.461
growth or middle-class security.

00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:09.361
And it doesn't have to.

00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:12.328
My budget will make critical
investments to grow the economy,

00:03:12.328 --> 00:03:15.928
create jobs, and strengthen
the middle class.

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:18.494
As I said in my State of the
Union Address, every day,

00:03:18.494 --> 00:03:21.261
we should ask ourselves
three questions:

00:03:21.261 --> 00:03:24.194
How do we make America
a magnet for good jobs?

00:03:24.194 --> 00:03:26.194
How do we give our workers
the skills they need to

00:03:26.194 --> 00:03:27.528
do those jobs?

00:03:27.528 --> 00:03:30.494
And how do we make sure
that hard work leads to a

00:03:30.494 --> 00:03:32.461
decent living?

00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:34.161
To make America a
magnet for good jobs,

00:03:34.161 --> 00:03:36.695
we'll invest in high-tech
manufacturing and homegrown

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:40.127
American energy, put people
to work building new roads,

00:03:40.127 --> 00:03:43.394
and bridges, and schools,
and cut red tape to help

00:03:43.394 --> 00:03:45.261
businesses grow.

00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:47.795
To give workers the skills
they need to do those jobs,

00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:50.961
we'll invest in education that
begins in the earliest years,

00:03:50.961 --> 00:03:53.961
and job training that better
equips workers to compete in a

00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:56.394
21st century economy.

00:03:56.394 --> 00:03:58.861
To make sure hard
work is rewarded,

00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:01.094
we'll build new ladders of
opportunity into the middle

00:04:01.094 --> 00:04:04.761
class, and focus on revitalizing
some of our communities

00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:07.895
hardest-hit by
recession and job loss.

00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:10.227
All of these investments will
help grow the economy and

00:04:10.227 --> 00:04:11.961
create jobs.

00:04:11.961 --> 00:04:14.528
None of them will
add to the deficit.

00:04:14.528 --> 00:04:17.227
And I will lay out these
priorities in greater detail in

00:04:17.227 --> 00:04:18.861
the days ahead.

00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:21.094
It's a budget that doesn't
spend beyond our means.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:24.861
And it's a budget that doesn't
make harsh and unnecessary cuts

00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:27.528
that only serve to
slow our economy.

00:04:27.528 --> 00:04:30.094
We'll keep our promise to an
aging generation by shoring

00:04:30.094 --> 00:04:31.094
up Medicare.

00:04:31.094 --> 00:04:34.561
And we'll keep our promise to
the next generation by investing

00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:37.594
in the fundamentals that have
always made America strong --

00:04:37.594 --> 00:04:42.361
manufacturing, innovation,
energy and education.

00:04:42.361 --> 00:04:44.828
Because that's what it'll take
to make sure America remains

00:04:44.828 --> 00:04:48.561
strong in the years ahead -- and
to leave behind something better

00:04:48.561 --> 00:04:49.994
for our kids.

00:04:49.994 --> 00:04:51.061
Thanks so much.

00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:52.127
Have a great weekend.
