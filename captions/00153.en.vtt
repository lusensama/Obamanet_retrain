00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:07.400
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.133
On Friday, I met with leaders of
both parties in Congress to try

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.600
and find a way forward in light
of the severe budget cuts --

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.767
known in Washington
as "the sequester" --

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:18.333
that have already started to
inflict pain on communities

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.166
across the country.

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.000
These cuts are not smart.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.967
They'll hurt our economy
and cost us jobs.

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:28.000
And Congress can turn
them off at any time --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.266
as soon as both sides are
willing to compromise.

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.567
As a nation, we've already
fought back from the worst

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.467
economic crisis
of our lifetimes,

00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:37.300
and we'll get through this, too.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.800
But at a time when our
businesses are finally gaining

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.567
some traction --
hiring new workers,

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:45.400
bringing jobs back to America --
the last thing Washington should

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.700
do is to get in their way.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.934
That's what these cuts
to education and research,

00:00:49.934 --> 00:00:51.667
and defense will do.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:53.166
It's unnecessary.

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.533
And at a time when too many of
our friends and neighbors are

00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:59.200
still looking for
work, it's inexcusable.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.900
Now, it's important
to understand that,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.133
while not everyone will feel the
pain of these cuts right away,

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.300
the pain will be real.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.300
Many middle-class families will
have their lives disrupted in a

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.033
significant way.

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:13.734
Beginning this week, businesses
that work with the military will

00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:15.400
have to lay folks off.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.100
Communities near military
bases will take a serious blow.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.333
Hundreds of thousands of
Americans who serve their

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.900
country -- Border Patrol
agents, FBI agents,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.300
civilians who work for
the Defense Department --

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.000
will see their wages cut
and their hours reduced.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.433
This will cause a ripple
effect across the economy.

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:37.000
Businesses will suffer because
customers will have less

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.467
money to spend.

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:42.100
The longer these cuts remain in
place, the greater the damage.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.333
Economists estimate they could
eventually cost us more than

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:48.700
750,000 jobs and slow our
economy by over one-half of

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.200
one percent.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.233
Here's the thing: none
of this is necessary.

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:55.900
It's happening because
Republicans in Congress chose

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.166
this outcome over closing a
single wasteful tax loophole

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.567
that helps reduce the deficit.

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:04.133
Just this week, they decided
that protecting special interest

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:07.700
tax breaks for the well-off and
well-connected is more important

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.166
than protecting our military
and middle-class families

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:12.166
from these cuts.

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:14.800
I still believe we can and
must replace these cuts with a

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.166
balanced approach -- one that
combines smart spending cuts

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:20.900
with entitlement reform and
changes to our tax code that

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.867
make it more fair for families
and businesses without raising

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:25.734
anyone's tax rates.

00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:28.066
That's how we can reduce our
deficit without laying off

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:31.867
workers, or forcing parents
and students to pay the price.

00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:34.000
I don't think that's
too much to ask.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.133
It's the kind of approach I've
proposed for two years now.

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:39.266
A majority of the American
people agree with me on this

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:42.734
approach -- including a
majority of Republicans.

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:45.367
We just need Republicans in
Congress to catch up with their

00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:47.934
own party and the
rest of the country.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.667
Now, I know there are
Republicans in Congress who

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:54.166
would actually rather see tax
loopholes closed than let these

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:55.734
cuts go through.

00:02:55.734 --> 00:02:57.767
And I know there are Democrats
who'd rather do smart

00:02:57.767 --> 00:03:01.033
entitlement reform than
let these cuts go through.

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:03.600
There's a caucus of
common sense out there.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.967
And I'm going to keep
reaching out to them to fix

00:03:05.967 --> 00:03:07.667
this for good.

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:11.166
Because the American people are
weary of perpetual partisanship

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:12.867
and brinksmanship.

00:03:12.867 --> 00:03:16.834
This is America, and in America,
we don't just bounce from one

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:19.100
manufactured crisis to another.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.767
We make smart choices.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:21.767
We plan.

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:23.066
We prioritize.

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:25.734
So I'm going to push through
this paralysis and keep fighting

00:03:25.734 --> 00:03:29.166
for the real challenges
facing middle-class families.

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:31.800
I'm going to keep pushing for
high-quality preschool for every

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.500
family that wants it, and make
sure the minimum wage becomes a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.000
wage you can live on.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.767
I'm going to keep pushing to
fix our immigration system,

00:03:38.767 --> 00:03:40.834
repair our
transportation system,

00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:44.233
and keep our children
safe from gun violence.

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:46.300
That's the work you
elected me to do.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.166
And that's what I'm focused
on every single day.

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:50.266
Thanks so much.
