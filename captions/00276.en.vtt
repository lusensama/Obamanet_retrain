00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:09.792
The President:
75 years ago today, in the midst of the Great Depression,

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:13.291
Franklin Roosevelt signed
Social Security into law,

00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:15.725
laying a cornerstone in the
foundation of America's middle

00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:19.024
class, and assuring generations
of America's seniors that after

00:00:19.024 --> 00:00:23.591
a lifetime of hard work, they'd
have a chance to retire with dignity.

00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:25.958
We have an obligation
to keep that promise;

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.558
to safeguard Social
Security for our seniors,

00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:31.425
people with disabilities,
and for all Americans --

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:34.291
today, tomorrow, and forever.

00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:37.591
Now, we've been talking for a
long time about how to do that;

00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:40.692
about how to make sure Social
Security is healthy enough to

00:00:40.692 --> 00:00:43.692
cover the higher costs that are
kicking in now that baby boomers

00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:45.224
are retiring.

00:00:45.224 --> 00:00:47.091
And I'm committed to
working with anyone,

00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:51.558
Democrat or Republican, who wants to strengthen Social Security.

00:00:51.558 --> 00:00:54.091
I'm also encouraged by the
reports of serious bipartisan

00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:57.325
work being done on this and
other issues in the fiscal

00:00:57.325 --> 00:01:00.291
commission that I set
up several months ago.

00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:03.158
One thing we can't afford to
do though is privatize Social

00:01:03.158 --> 00:01:07.024
Security -- an ill-conceived idea that would add trillions of

00:01:07.024 --> 00:01:10.291
dollars to our budget deficit while tying your benefits to the

00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:14.391
whims of Wall Street traders and the ups and downs of the stock market.

00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:18.625
A few years ago, we had a
debate about privatizing Social Security.

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:21.458
And I'd have thought that debate
would've been put to rest once

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:25.191
and for all by the financial
crisis we've just experienced.

00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:27.925
I'd have thought, after being
reminded how quickly the stock

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:31.558
market can tumble, after seeing
the wealth people worked a

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.625
lifetime to earn wiped
out in a matter of days,

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:37.091
that no one would want to place
bets with Social Security on

00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:41.024
Wall Street; that everyone would
understand why we need to be

00:01:41.024 --> 00:01:43.825
prudent about investing the
retirement money of tens of

00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:45.692
millions of Americans.

00:01:45.692 --> 00:01:47.792
But some Republican leaders in
Congress don't seem to have

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:50.792
learned any lessons
from the past few years.

00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:52.858
They're pushing to make
privatizing Social Security a

00:01:52.858 --> 00:01:56.558
key part of their legislative
agenda if they win a majority in

00:01:56.558 --> 00:01:58.358
Congress this fall.

00:01:58.358 --> 00:02:00.892
It's right up there on their
to-do list with repealing some

00:02:00.892 --> 00:02:03.892
of the Medicare benefits and
reforms that are adding at least

00:02:03.892 --> 00:02:07.858
a dozen years to the fiscal
health of Medicare --

00:02:07.858 --> 00:02:10.425
the single longest
extension in history.

00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:13.758
That agenda is wrong for
seniors, it's wrong for America,

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:15.358
and I won't let it happen.

00:02:15.358 --> 00:02:17.091
Not while I'm President.

00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:18.825
I'll fight with everything I've
got to stop those who would

00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:21.458
gamble your Social
Security on Wall Street.

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:23.925
Because you shouldn't be worried
that a sudden downturn in the

00:02:23.925 --> 00:02:27.291
stock market will put all
you've worked so hard for --

00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:30.024
all you've earned -- at risk.

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:32.458
You should have the peace of
mind of knowing that after

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:34.991
meeting your responsibilities
and paying into the system all

00:02:34.991 --> 00:02:38.758
your lives, you'll get
the benefits you deserve.

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:42.491
75 years ago today, Franklin
Roosevelt made a promise.

00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:46.558
He promised that from that
day forward, we'd offer --

00:02:46.558 --> 00:02:49.991
"some measure of protection to
the average citizen and to his

00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:53.491
family against...poverty-stricken old age."

00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:56.958
That's a promise each generation
of Americans has kept.

00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.625
And it's a promise America will
continue to keep so long as I

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:02.425
have the honor of
serving as President.

00:03:02.425 --> 00:03:03.792
Thanks for listening.

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:05.358
Thanks for watching.

00:03:05.358 --> 00:03:06.892
And have a wonderful weekend.
