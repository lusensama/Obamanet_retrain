00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.367
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:10.133
A few weeks ago, we launched
an important new part

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.133
of the Affordable Care Act.

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.700
It's called the Marketplace.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.033
And for Americans
without health insurance,

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.166
and Americans who buy
insurance on their own

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:22.233
because they can't get it
at work, it's a very big deal.

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:24.700
If you're one of those people,
the Affordable Care Act

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.600
makes you part of a big group
plan for the first time.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.000
The Marketplace is where
you can apply and shop

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
for affordable new
health insurance choices.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.934
It gathers insurers
under one system

00:00:35.934 --> 00:00:38.133
to compete for your business.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.133
And that choice and
competition have actually

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.033
helped bring prices down.

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:44.934
Ultimately, the easiest
way to buy insurance

00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:48.567
in this Marketplace will be
a new website, HealthCare.gov.

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:51.333
But as you may have heard,
the site isn't working

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.266
the way it's supposed to yet.

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.367
That's frustrating for all
of us who have worked so hard

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:58.734
to make sure everyone who
needs it gets health care.

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:00.734
And it's especially frustrating
for the Americans

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:02.734
who've been trying
to get covered.

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:06.467
The site has been visited more
than 20 million times so far.

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:10.300
Nearly 700,000 people have
applied for coverage already.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.400
That proves just
how much demand there is

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.166
for these new quality, 
affordable health care choices.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.567
And that's why,
in the coming weeks,

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:21.600
we are going to get it working
as smoothly as it's supposed to.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.400
We've got people
working overtime, 24/7,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.400
to boost capacity and
address these problems,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.767
every single day.

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:31.367
But even as we
improve the website,

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:34.100
remember that the website
isn't the only way

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.367
to apply for coverage
under these new plans.

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:40.000
We've updated HealthCare.gov
to offer more information

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.867
about enrolling over
the phone, by mail,

00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:46.333
or in person with a
specially-trained navigator

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.767
who can help
answer your questions.

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:58.734
Just call 1-800-318-2596 or
visit LocalHelp.HealthCare.gov.

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:01.900
And don't worry -
these plans will not sell out.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.467
We're only a few weeks into
a six-month open enrollment

00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:07.000
period, and everyone
who wants insurance

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.533
through the Marketplace
will get it.

00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:11.233
Some people have poked
fun at me this week

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:13.433
for sounding like
an insurance salesman.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.033
And that's okay.

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:17.166
I'd still be out there
championing this law

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:19.900
even if the
website were perfect.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.800
I'll never stop fighting to help
more hardworking Americans

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.834
know the economic
security of health care.

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:27.900
That's something
we should all want.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.266
That's why it's also interesting
to see Republicans in Congress

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:32.834
expressing so much concern
that people are having trouble

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:35.800
buying health insurance
through the new website -

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.900
especially considering

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.867
they've spent the
last few years so obsessed

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:42.667
with denying those same people 
access to health insurance

00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:44.033
that they just
shut down the government

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:46.800
and threatened default over it.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.967
As I've said many times before,
I'm willing to work

00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:51.867
with anyone, on any idea,
who's actually willing

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:53.500
to make this law perform better.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.066
But it's well past the time
for folks to stop rooting

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:58.800
for its failure.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.834
Because hardworking,
middle-class families

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:03.266
are rooting for its success.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.500
The Affordable Care Act gives
people who've been stuck with

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.834
sky-high premiums because
of preexisting conditions

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:13.333
the chance to get affordable
insurance for the first time.

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:15.333
This law means that women
can finally buy coverage

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:17.767
that doesn't charge them
higher premiums than men

00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:19.500
for the same care.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.166
And everyone who already
has health insurance,

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:25.200
whether through your employer,
Medicare, or Medicaid,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.867
will keep the benefits
and protections this law

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:30.367
has already put in place.

00:03:30.367 --> 00:03:32.367
Three million more young
adults have health insurance

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:35.667
on their parents' plans because
of the Affordable Care Act.

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:38.266
More than six million
people on Medicare have saved

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:41.600
an average of $1,000
on their prescription medicine

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.033
because of
the Affordable Care Act.

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:46.266
Last year, more than 8 million
Americans received

00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:48.266
half a billion
dollars in refunds

00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:52.100
from their insurers because
of the Affordable Care Act.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.100
And for tens of
millions of women,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.734
preventive care like mammograms
and birth control are free

00:03:57.734 --> 00:04:00.500
because of the
Affordable Care Act.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.967
That's all part of this
law, and it's here to stay.

00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:07.867
We did not fight so hard for
this reform for so many years

00:04:07.867 --> 00:04:09.567
just to build a website.

00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:11.900
We did it to free millions
of American families

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.567
from the awful fear
that one illness or injury -

00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:16.467
to yourself or your child -

00:04:16.467 --> 00:04:19.834
might cost you everything
you'd worked so hard to build.

00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:22.700
We did it to cement the
principle that in this country,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.734
the security of health care

00:04:23.734 --> 00:04:26.400
is not a privilege
for a fortunate few,

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.700
but a right for
every one of us to enjoy.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.233
We have already delivered
on part of that promise,

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:35.834
and we will not rest
until the work is done.

00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:38.133
Thanks,
and have a great weekend.
