00:00:08.628 --> 00:00:11.261
President Obama:
After the worst recession
since the Great Depression,

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:13.795
our economy is growing again,
and we've gained almost

00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:17.761
2 million private sector
jobs over the last 13 months.

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:20.561
But I also know that a lot of
folks aren't feeling as positive

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:23.194
as some of those
statistics might suggest.

00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:25.261
It's still too
hard to find a job.

00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:27.795
And even if you have a job,
chances are you're having a

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:30.161
tougher time paying the rising
costs of everything from

00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:32.294
groceries to gas.

00:00:32.294 --> 00:00:35.661
In some places, gas is
now more than $4 a gallon,

00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:40.695
meaning that you could be paying upwards
of $50 or $60 to fill up your tank.

00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:43.994
Of course, while rising gas
prices mean real pain for our

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:48.361
families at the pump, they also mean
bigger profits for oil companies.

00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:50.528
This week, the largest oil
companies announced that they'd

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:56.094
made more than $25 billion in
the first few months of 2011 --

00:00:56.094 --> 00:00:59.394
up about 30% from last year.

00:00:59.394 --> 00:01:02.761
Now, I don't have any problem
with any company or industry

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.061
being rewarded
for their success.

00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:08.728
The incentive of healthy profits
is what fuels entrepreneurialism

00:01:08.728 --> 00:01:11.194
and helps drive our
economy forward.

00:01:11.194 --> 00:01:14.961
But I do have a problem with
unwarranted taxpayer subsidies

00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:17.828
that we've been handing out
to oil and gas companies --

00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:20.928
to the tune of $4
billion a year.

00:01:20.928 --> 00:01:23.428
When oil companies are
making huge profits already,

00:01:23.428 --> 00:01:25.294
and you're struggling
at the pump,

00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:27.695
and we're scouring the federal
budget for spending we can

00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:31.961
afford to do without, these
tax giveaways aren't right.

00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:33.127
They aren't smart.

00:01:33.127 --> 00:01:34.728
And we need to end them.

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:38.027
That's why, earlier this week, I
renewed my call to Congress to

00:01:38.027 --> 00:01:41.428
stop subsidizing the
oil and gas industries.

00:01:41.428 --> 00:01:44.127
Understand, I'm not
opposed to producing oil.

00:01:44.127 --> 00:01:46.261
I believe that if we're serious
about meeting our energy

00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:49.261
challenge, we need to
operate on all cylinders,

00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:52.127
and that means pursuing a
broad range of energy policies,

00:01:52.127 --> 00:01:55.895
including safe and a responsible
oil production here at home.

00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:58.027
In fact, last year, America's
oil production reached its

00:01:58.027 --> 00:02:01.227
highest level since 2003.

00:02:01.227 --> 00:02:03.528
But I also believe that instead
of subsidizing yesterday's

00:02:03.528 --> 00:02:06.361
energy, we should
invest in tomorrow's --

00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:08.294
and that's what
we've been doing.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.328
Already, we've seen how the
investments we're making in

00:02:10.328 --> 00:02:13.994
clean energy can lead to new
jobs and new businesses.

00:02:13.994 --> 00:02:16.961
I've seen some of them myself --
small businesses that are making

00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:18.594
the most of solar
and wind power,

00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:21.261
and energy-efficient technologies;

00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:23.828
big companies that are making
fuel-efficient cars and trucks

00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:26.261
part of their vehicle fleets.

00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:28.194
And to promote these
kinds of vehicles,

00:02:28.194 --> 00:02:31.027
we implemented historic
new fuel-economy standards,

00:02:31.027 --> 00:02:35.528
which could save you as
much as $3,000 at the pump.

00:02:35.528 --> 00:02:38.428
Now, I know that in this
tough fiscal environment,

00:02:38.428 --> 00:02:40.728
it's tempting for some in
Washington to want to cut our

00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:42.861
investments in clean energy.

00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:45.928
And I absolutely agree that the
only way we'll be able to afford

00:02:45.928 --> 00:02:49.194
the things we need is if
we cut the things we don't,

00:02:49.194 --> 00:02:51.061
and live within our means.

00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:53.361
But I refuse to cut things like
clean energy that will help

00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:56.394
America win the future by
growing our economy and creating

00:02:56.394 --> 00:03:00.928
good-paying jobs that will
help make America more secure,

00:03:00.928 --> 00:03:04.127
and that will help clean up
our planet in the process.

00:03:04.127 --> 00:03:06.994
An investment in clean energy
today is an investment in a

00:03:06.994 --> 00:03:08.528
better tomorrow.

00:03:08.528 --> 00:03:11.328
And I think that's an
investment worth making.

00:03:11.328 --> 00:03:13.494
Thanks for listening,
and have a great weekend.
