00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:10.944
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:13.980
It's been seven years since
the worst financial crisis

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.317
in generations spread from
Wall Street to Main Street -

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:20.587
a crisis that cost millions
of Americans their jobs,

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:23.323
their homes, their
life savings.

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:26.092
It was a crisis
that cost all of us.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:30.563
It was a reminder that we're
in this together - all of us.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.832
That's how we've battled
back these past six and a

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.335
half years - together.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:37.837
We still have work to do,
but together, we prevented a

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.239
second Great Depression.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.175
Our businesses have created
nearly 13 million jobs over

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:43.977
the past 64 months.

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:46.379
The housing market
is healthier.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.848
The stock market has more
than doubled, restoring the

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.917
retirement savings
of millions.

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:54.020
Americans of all stripes
buckled down, rolled up

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.424
their sleeves, and worked
to bring this country back.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:01.294
And to protect your efforts,
we had to do something more

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.163
- we had to make sure this
kind of crisis never

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:05.098
happens again.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:07.934
That's why five years ago
this week, we enacted the

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:11.838
toughest Wall Street reform
in history - new rules of

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:14.841
the road to protect
businesses, consumers, and

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:18.011
our entire economy from the
kind of irresponsibility

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:19.712
that threatened all of us.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:23.883
Five years later, here's
what that reform has done.

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:26.619
Wall Street Reform turned
the page on the era of "too

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.655
big to fail."

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.292
Now, in America, we welcome
the pursuit of profit.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.327
But if your business fails,
we shouldn't have to bail

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.596
you out.

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.865
And under the new rules,
we won't - the days of

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:40.567
taxpayer-funded
bailouts are over.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.236
Wall Street Reform now
allows us to crack down on

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.839
some of the worst types of
recklessness that brought

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.741
our economy to its knees,
from big banks making huge,

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.644
risky bets using borrowed
money, to paying executives

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:54.380
in a way that rewarded
irresponsible behavior.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.683
Thanks to Wall Street
Reform, there's finally an

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:59.052
independent Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:02.021
with one mission: to
protect American consumers.

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.657
Already, they've gone after
predatory or unscrupulous

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:06.826
mortgage brokers, student
lenders, credit card

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:10.630
companies, and they've won
-putting nearly $11 billion

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.666
back in the pockets of more
than 26 million consumers

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.001
who've been cheated.

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.803
So this law is working.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.838
And we're working to
protect even more families.

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:21.241
Just this week, we announced
that we're cracking down on

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.343
the worst practices of
payday lenders on military

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:26.412
bases, so that our troops
and their families don't

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:29.115
wind up trapped in a
vicious cycle of debt.

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.284
As long as I'm President,
I'm going to keep doing

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:34.320
whatever I can to protect
consumers, and our entire

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.823
economy from the kind of
irresponsibility that led to

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.058
the Great Recession
in the first place.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.160
None of this has been easy.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.930
We've had to overcome fierce
lobbying campaigns from the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.399
special interests and
their allies in Congress.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.035
In fact, they're still
trying everything to attack

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:53.339
everything this reform
accomplishes-from hiding

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.708
rollbacks of key protections
in unrelated bills, to

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:58.044
blocking the financial cops
on the beat from doing

00:02:58.044 --> 00:02:59.212
their job.

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.381
And they continue to claim
this Wall Street reform is

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.116
somehow bad for business.

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:05.718
But that doesn't explain 13
million new jobs and a stock

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.854
market near record highs.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.423
This law is only bad for
business if your business

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:12.692
model depends on
recklessness that threatens

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.761
our economy or
irresponsibility that

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:16.596
threatens working families.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:19.065
We can't put the security
of families at risk by

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.734
returning to the days when
big banks or bad actors were

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:24.270
allowed to write
their own rules.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.739
And if any bill comes to my
desk that tries to unravel

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.976
the new rules on Wall
Street, I will veto it.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:33.246
We've worked too hard to
recover from one crisis only

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.481
to risk another.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:38.718
In America, we should reward
drive, innovation, and

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.153
fair play.

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:43.356
That's what Wall
Street reform does.

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:46.359
It makes sure everybody
plays by the same set of rules.

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.295
And if we keep moving
forward, not backward - if

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:52.298
we keep building an economy
that rewards responsibility

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.601
instead of recklessness,
then we won't just keep

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:57.303
coming back - we'll come
back stronger than ever.

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:59.772
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
