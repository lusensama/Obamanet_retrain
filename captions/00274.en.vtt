00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:11.761
The President:
On Tuesday, after
more than seven years,

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.661
the United States of America
will end its combat mission in

00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:18.194
Iraq and take an important step
forward in responsibly ending

00:00:18.194 --> 00:00:20.361
the Iraq war.

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:24.361
As a candidate for this office,
I pledged I would end this war.

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:26.928
As President, that's
what I'm doing.

00:00:26.928 --> 00:00:30.695
I brought home more than 90,000 troops since I took office.

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:34.695
We have closed or turned over
to Iraq hundreds of bases.

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:37.628
In many parts of the country,
Iraqis have already taken the

00:00:37.628 --> 00:00:39.594
lead for security.

00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:42.761
In the months ahead, our troops
will continue to support and

00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:46.461
train Iraqi forces, partner
with Iraqis in counterterrorism

00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:50.661
missions, and protect our
civilians and military efforts.

00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:54.494
But the bottom line is
this: the war is ending.

00:00:54.494 --> 00:00:56.828
Like any sovereign,
independent nation,

00:00:56.828 --> 00:00:59.494
Iraq is free to
chart its own course.

00:00:59.494 --> 00:01:03.761
And by the end of next year,
all of our troops will be home.

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:06.828
As we mark the end of America's
combat mission in Iraq,

00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:10.961
a grateful nation must pay
tribute to all who have served there.

00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:13.695
Because part of responsibly
ending this war is meeting our

00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:16.728
responsibility to those
who have fought it.

00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:21.094
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
now make up America's longest

00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:23.795
continuous combat engagement.

00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:27.161
For the better part of a decade,
our troops and their families

00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:31.428
have served tour after tour
with honor and heroism,

00:01:31.428 --> 00:01:34.361
risking and often giving their
lives for the defense of our

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:36.428
freedom and security.

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:39.961
More than one million Americans
in uniform have served in Iraq

00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:43.061
-- far more than any
conflict since Vietnam.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:46.227
And more than one million who
have served in both wars have

00:01:46.227 --> 00:01:49.528
now finished their service
and joined the proud ranks of

00:01:49.528 --> 00:01:51.661
America's veterans.

00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:55.227
What this new generation of
veterans must know is this: our

00:01:55.227 --> 00:01:58.461
nation's commitment to all who
wear its uniform is a sacred

00:01:58.461 --> 00:02:02.461
trust that is as old
as our republic itself.

00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:07.928
It is one that, as President, I
consider a moral obligation to uphold.

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:11.594
At the same time, these are
new wars; with new missions,

00:02:11.594 --> 00:02:14.161
new methods, and new perils.

00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:16.261
And what today's
veterans have earned --

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:18.494
what they have every
right to expect --

00:02:18.494 --> 00:02:22.294
is new care, new opportunity,
and a new commitment to their

00:02:22.294 --> 00:02:24.528
service when they come home.

00:02:24.528 --> 00:02:27.728
That's why, from the earliest
days of my Administration,

00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:30.895
we've been strengthening that
sacred trust with our veterans

00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:34.061
by making our veterans policy
more responsive and ready for

00:02:34.061 --> 00:02:35.928
this new century.

00:02:35.928 --> 00:02:38.194
We're building a
21st century VA,

00:02:38.194 --> 00:02:41.528
modernizing and expanding VA
hospitals and health care,

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:46.494
and adapting care to better
meet the unique needs of female veterans.

00:02:46.494 --> 00:02:48.628
We're creating a single
electronic health record that

00:02:48.628 --> 00:02:52.061
our troops and veterans
can keep for life.

00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:54.561
We're breaking the claims
backlog and reforming the

00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:57.127
process with new
paperless systems.

00:02:57.127 --> 00:02:59.928
And we're building new wounded
warrior facilities through the

00:02:59.928 --> 00:03:02.127
Department of Defense.

00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:04.528
But for many of our
troops and their families,

00:03:04.528 --> 00:03:07.061
the war doesn't end
when they come home.

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.127
Too many suffer from Traumatic
Brain Injury and Post-Traumatic

00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:14.361
Stress Disorder -- the signature injuries of today's wars --

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:17.828
and too few receive
proper screening or care.

00:03:17.828 --> 00:03:19.628
Well, we're changing that.

00:03:19.628 --> 00:03:22.227
We're directing significant
resources to treatment,

00:03:22.227 --> 00:03:24.294
hiring more mental
health professionals,

00:03:24.294 --> 00:03:27.628
and making major investments
in awareness, outreach,

00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:29.695
and suicide prevention.

00:03:29.695 --> 00:03:32.528
And we're making it easier
for a vet with PTSD to get the

00:03:32.528 --> 00:03:35.027
benefits he or she needs.

00:03:35.027 --> 00:03:36.928
To make sure our
troops, veterans,

00:03:36.928 --> 00:03:39.761
and their families have full
access to the American Dreams

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:44.261
they've fought to defend, we're
working to extend them new opportunity.

00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:47.261
Michelle and Jill Biden have
forged a national commitment to

00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:51.194
support military families
while a loved one is away.

00:03:51.194 --> 00:03:54.227
We've guaranteed new support to
caregivers who put their lives

00:03:54.227 --> 00:03:57.428
on hold for a loved
one's long recovery.

00:03:57.428 --> 00:04:00.961
We're funding and implementing
the Post-9/11 GI Bill,

00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:04.294
which is already helping some 300,000 veterans and their

00:04:04.294 --> 00:04:08.861
family members pursue their dream of a college education.

00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:12.294
And for veterans trying to find
work in a very tough economy,

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:15.994
we've devoted new resources to
job training and placement.

00:04:15.994 --> 00:04:17.928
I've directed the federal
government to hire more

00:04:17.928 --> 00:04:20.428
veterans, including
disabled veterans,

00:04:20.428 --> 00:04:24.494
and I encourage every business
in America to follow suit.

00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:27.494
This new generation of veterans
has proven itself to be a new

00:04:27.494 --> 00:04:29.328
generation of leaders.

00:04:29.328 --> 00:04:33.127
They have unmatched training and
skills; they're ready to work;

00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:37.628
and our country is stronger
when we tap their extraordinary talents.

00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:38.761
New care.

00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:40.494
New opportunity.

00:04:40.494 --> 00:04:43.261
A new commitment
to our veterans.

00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:46.061
If you'd like to send our troops
and veterans a message of thanks

00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:49.695
and support, just
visit whitehouse.gov.

00:04:49.695 --> 00:04:53.961
There, you'll find an easy way
to upload your own text or video.

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:56.695
Let them know that they have
the respect and support of a

00:04:56.695 --> 00:04:58.428
grateful nation.

00:04:58.428 --> 00:05:02.561
That when their tour ends;
when they see our flag;

00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:05.761
when they touch our soil;
they'll always be home in an

00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:08.594
America that is forever
here for them --

00:05:08.594 --> 00:05:11.294
just as they've
been there for us.

00:05:11.294 --> 00:05:14.328
That's the promise our nation
makes to those who serve.

00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:16.194
And as long as I'm
Commander-in-Chief,

00:05:16.194 --> 00:05:18.594
it's a promise we will keep.

00:05:18.594 --> 00:05:19.728
Thank you.
