00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.579
The President: Hello, everybody.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.382
In our house, everybody
knows that President is only

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:18.084
the third-most important
job in the family.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.153
So this weekend, I'm going
to take a little extra time

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:23.423
to say thank you to Michelle
for the remarkable way she

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.192
does the most important
job: being a mom.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:29.662
And I'm going to give extra
thanks to my mother-in-law

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:32.098
for the role model she's
always been to Michelle and

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:34.467
the countless selfless
ways in which she's helped

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.837
Michelle and me raise
Malia and Sasha.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:42.108
I am incredibly lucky to
have women who help me

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:46.045
raise, love, and
look after our girls.

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:48.047
I hope you'll also take a
moment to say thank you to

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:50.817
the women in your life who
love you in that special way

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.385
mothers do.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.755
Biological moms, adoptive
moms, and foster moms;

00:00:55.755 --> 00:01:00.393
single moms, grandmoms
and godmothers; aunts and

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:03.062
mentors - whomever you
think of

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:05.565
when you think of Mother's Day.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.168
Or take a moment, like I
will, to remember the moms

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:11.171
who raised us, whose big
hearts sustained us, and

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:14.908
whom we miss every day,
no matter how old we get.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.910
Giving flowers is
always a good idea.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.078
But I hope that on this
Mother's Day, we'll recommit

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:22.715
ourselves to doing more than
that: Through deeds that

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.518
match our words, let's give
mothers the respect they

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:29.756
deserve, give all women the
equality they deserve, and

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.425
give all parents the support
they need

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.594
in their most important roles.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:38.064
That includes paid maternity
and paternity leave, sick

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:41.468
leave, accommodations for
workers who are pregnant,

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:45.104
good health care, affordable
child care, flexibility at

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:49.175
work, equal pay, and a
decent minimum wage.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:52.145
We ask our mothers to do
more than their fair share

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.880
of just about everything.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.785
Making sure they're treated
fairly is the least we can do.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.854
The idea of setting aside
a Sunday in May for our

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:03.990
mothers became an official
holiday with a Congressional

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.993
resolution a little more
than 100 years ago.

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:10.196
They did it on May 8 - the
same day we'll celebrate

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:12.131
Mother's Day this year.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:14.667
If Congress can make a
holiday, surely they can

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.303
back it up with the things
that give it meaning.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.305
After all, that's what
my mother taught me.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.307
I couldn't just say I was
going to do the right thing,

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.910
or say I agreed with
it on principle.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.578
I had to actually do it.

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:28.147
So this Mother's
Day, say thank you.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.782
Say, "I love you."

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.918
And let's make sure we
show that gratitude and

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:35.622
appreciation through acts of
respect throughout the year.

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:38.558
No one deserves that
more than our moms.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:40.560
Happy Mother's Day, and
have a great weekend.
