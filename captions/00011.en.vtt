00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:11.878
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:15.348
I'm speaking to you today
from Springfield, Illinois.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.283
I spent eight years in
the state senate here.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.253
It was a place where, for
all our surface differences

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:22.789
in a state as
diverse as Illinois,

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.992
my colleagues and I actually
shared a lot in common.

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:27.994
We fought for
our principles,

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:29.195
and voted against
each other,

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.098
but because we assumed
the best in one another,

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:35.769
not the worst, we found
room for progress.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.472
We bridged differences
to get things done.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:41.474
In my travels
through this state,

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:44.377
I saw most Americans
do the same.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.379
Folks know that issues
are complicated,

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.381
and that people with
different ideas might

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.016
have a point.

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:52.786
It convinced me that if we
just approached our politics

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.522
the same way we approach
our daily lives,

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.224
with common sense, a
commitment to fairness,

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.493
and the belief that we're
all in this together,

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.229
there's nothing we can't do.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.231
That's why I
announced, right here,

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.233
in Springfield that I was
running for President.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.270
And my faith in the
generosity and fundamental

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.275
goodness of the American
people is rewarded every day.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.277
But I'll be the first to
admit that the tone of our

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:20.880
politics hasn't gotten
better, but worse.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.882
Too many people feel like
the system is rigged,

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.518
and their voices
don't matter.

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:27.520
And when good people
are pushed away from

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.756
participating in
our public life,

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:33.359
more powerful and extreme
voices will fill the void.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.495
They'll be the ones who gain
control over decisions that

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.997
could send a young
soldier to war,

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:40.433
or allow another
economic crisis,

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.836
or roll back the rights that
generations of Americans

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:45.772
have fought to secure.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.007
The good news is there's
also a lot we can do about

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.543
this, from reducing the
influence of money in our

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:53.480
politics, to changing the
way we draw congressional

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.149
districts, to simply
changing the way we treat

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.784
each other.

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:00.153
That's what I came back here
to talk about this week.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.355
And I hope you check
out my full speech

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:04.357
at WhiteHouse.gov.

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:06.359
One thing I focused
on, for example,

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.595
was how we can make voting
easier, not harder,

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:11.664
and modernize it for
the way we live now.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:14.334
Here in Illinois, a new law
allows citizens to register

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:17.337
and vote at the polls
on Election Day.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.272
It also expands
early voting,

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:21.274
which makes it much easier
for working folks

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.976
and busy parents.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.345
We're also considering
automatic voter registration

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.313
for every citizen when
they apply

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.314
for a driver's license.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:31.117
And I'm calling on more
states to adopt steps

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:32.452
like these.

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:34.354
Because when
more of us vote,

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:36.656
the less captive our
politics will be to narrow

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.392
interests - and the better
our democracy will be for

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:41.861
our children.

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:44.597
Nine years after I first
announced for this office,

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:47.300
I still believe in
a politics of hope.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.903
And for all the challenges
of a changing world;

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:52.906
for all the imperfections
of our democracy;

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:55.775
choosing a politics of hope
is something that's entirely

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:57.911
up to each of us.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.913
Thanks, everybody.
