00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.200
The President:
Hi, everybody,
and Happy New Year.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.700
This is a time when we look
ahead to all the possibilities

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.233
and opportunities
of the year to come -

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:20.133
when we resolve
to better ourselves,

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.700
and to better our
relationships with one another.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.400
And today,
I want to talk about one place

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.300
that Washington should start -

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.467
a place where we can make
a real and powerful difference

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:33.100
in the lives of many of our
fellow Americans right now.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.600
Just a few days after Christmas,
more than one million

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.233
of our fellow Americans lost
a vital economic lifeline -

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:42.500
the temporary insurance that
helps folks make ends meet

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.667
while they look for a job.

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:46.667
Republicans in Congress went
home for the holidays

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:48.567
and let that lifeline expire.

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:50.867
And for many of their
constituents who are unemployed

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:52.467
through no fault of their own,

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:56.300
that decision will leave
them with no income at all.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.633
We make this promise
to one another

00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.533
because it makes
a difference to a mother

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:03.100
who needs help feeding her kids
while she's looking for work;

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.934
makes a difference to a father
who needs help paying the rent

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:09.667
while learning the skills
to get a new and better job.

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:12.800
And denying families that
security is just plain cruel.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.734
We're a better
country than that.

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:17.633
We don't abandon our fellow
Americans when times get tough -

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:22.600
we keep the faith with them
until they start that new job.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.066
What's more, it actually slows
down the economy for all of us.

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.567
If folks can't
pay their bills

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:30.000
or buy the basics,
like food and clothes,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.567
local businesses take
a hit and hire fewer workers.

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:35.567
That's why the independent
Congressional Budget Office

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:38.367
says that unless Congress
restores this insurance,

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:41.100
we'll feel a drag on our
economic growth this year.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.166
And after our businesses created

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.767
more than two million
new jobs last year,

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:48.633
that's a self-inflicted
wound we don't need.

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:50.700
So when Congress comes
back to work this week,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.066
their first order of business
should be making this right.

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:56.567
Right now, a bipartisan group
in Congress is working

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:59.467
on a three-month extension
of unemployment insurance -

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:02.467
and if they pass it,
I will sign it.

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:05.433
For decades, Republicans
and Democrats put partisanship

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:09.834
and ideology aside to offer
some security for job-seekers,

00:02:09.834 --> 00:02:13.200
even when the unemployment rate
was lower than it is today.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.133
Instead of punishing families
who can least afford it,

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:18.633
Republicans should make it
their New Year's resolution

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:19.934
to do the right thing,

00:02:19.934 --> 00:02:22.600
and restore this vital
economic security

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.166
for their
constituents right now.

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:27.233
After all, our focus
as a country this year

00:02:27.233 --> 00:02:30.533
shouldn't be shrinking
our economy, but growing it;

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:33.600
not narrowing opportunity,
but expanding it;

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.867
not fewer jobs,
but doing everything we can

00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:39.000
to help our businesses create 
more of the good jobs

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.133
that a growing
middle class requires.

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:43.633
That's my
New Year's resolution -

00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:46.266
to do everything
I can, every single day,

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:50.066
to help make 2014 a year
in which more of our citizens

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.934
can earn their own piece
of the American Dream.

00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:55.700
After five years of working
and sacrificing to recover

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.600
and rebuild from crisis,

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.834
we have it within
our power, right now,

00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:01.734
to move this country forward.

00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:02.934
It's entirely up to us.

00:03:02.934 --> 00:03:06.567
And I'm optimistic for
the year that lies ahead.

00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:08.900
Thanks,
and have a great weekend.
