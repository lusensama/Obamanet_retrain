00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.378
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:13.646
The right to vote is one of
the most fundamental rights

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:15.749
of any democracy.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.351
Yet for too long, too many
of our fellow citizens were

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:21.054
denied that right, simply
because of the color of

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:22.455
their skin.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.392
Fifty years ago this week,
President Lyndon Johnson

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.694
signed a law to change that.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.363
The Voting Rights Act broke
down legal barriers that

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.732
stood between millions of
African Americans and their

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:36.236
constitutional right
to cast ballot.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:39.439
It was, and still is, one of
the greatest victories in

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:42.275
our country's struggle
for civil rights.

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:44.778
But it didn't
happen overnight.

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:47.480
Countless men and women
marched and organized, sat

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.551
in and stood up, for
our most basic rights.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:55.488
For this they were called
agitators and un-American,

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:58.091
they were jailed and beaten.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.693
Some were even killed.

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:03.463
But in the end, they
reaffirmed the idea at the

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:06.566
very heart of America: that
people who love this country

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.635
can change it.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.504
Our country is a better
place because of all those

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:13.373
heroes did for us.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.608
But as one of those heroes,
Congressman John Lewis,

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:18.244
reminded us in Selma this
past March, "There's still

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.046
work to be done."

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.715
Fifty years after the Voting
Rights Act, there are still

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.652
too many barriers to vote,
and too many people trying

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.387
to erect new ones.

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:29.856
We've seen laws that roll
back early voting, force

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:33.259
people to jump through hoops
to cast a ballot, or lead to

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.029
legitimate voters being
improperly purged

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:37.597
from the rolls.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:40.500
Over the years, we have seen
provisions specifically

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.669
designed to make it harder
for some of our fellow

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.671
citizens to vote.

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:48.241
In a democracy like ours,
with a history like ours,

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.676
that's a disgrace.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:52.879
That's why, as we celebrate
the 50th Anniversary of the

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.281
Voting Rights Act, I'm
calling on Congress to pass

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:59.085
new legislation to make sure
every American has equal

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.120
access to the polls.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.122
It's why I support the
organizers getting folks

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:04.958
registered in
their communities.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.094
And it's why, no matter
what party you support, my

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:11.531
message to every American is
simple: get out there and

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:15.535
vote - not just every four
years, but every chance you get.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:18.037
Because your elected
officials will only heed

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:21.641
your voice if you
make your voice heard.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.410
The promise that all of us
are created equal is written

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.747
into our founding documents
- but it's up to us to make

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.215
that promise real.

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:32.652
Together, let's do what
Americans have always done:

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:36.155
let's keep marching forward,
keep perfecting our union,

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:39.559
and keep building a better
country for our kids.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.060
Thanks everybody.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.795
Have a great weekend.
