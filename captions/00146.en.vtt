00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:07.233
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:10.533
Our top priority as a nation
must be growing the economy,

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.767
creating good jobs, and
rebuilding opportunity for the

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:14.133
middle class.

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.934
But two months ago, Congress
allowed a series of automatic

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:19.867
budget cuts to fall across the
federal government that would do

00:00:19.867 --> 00:00:21.433
the opposite.

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:24.834
In Washington-speak, these cuts
were called the "sequester."

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:26.367
It was a bad idea then.

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:29.834
And as the country saw this
week, it's a bad idea now.

00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:32.233
Because of these reckless cuts,
there are parents whose kids

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:34.867
just got kicked out of Head
Start programs who right now are

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:37.233
scrambling for a solution.

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:40.200
There are seniors who depend on
programs like Meals on Wheels to

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.000
live independently who
are looking for help.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.500
There are military
communities --

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.200
families that have obviously
already sacrificed enough --

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.333
who are coping under new strains
all because of these cuts.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.667
This week, the sequester
hurt travelers,

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:55.967
who were stuck for hours
in airports and on planes,

00:00:55.967 --> 00:00:58.367
and are rightly
frustrated by it.

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:00.667
And, maybe because they
fly home each weekend,

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:04.100
the Members of Congress who
insisted these cuts finally

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.066
realized that they
actually apply to them, too.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.066
Republicans claimed victory when
the sequester first took effect,

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:13.800
and now they've decided that
it was a bad idea all along.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.533
Well, first, they should
look at their own budget.

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:19.000
If the cuts they propose were
applied across the board,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.667
the FAA would suffer
cuts three times deeper.

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:24.834
So Congress passed
a temporary fix.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:25.867
A Band-Aid.

00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:28.834
But these cuts are scheduled to
keep falling across other parts

00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:31.233
of the government that provide
vital services for the

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:32.667
American people.

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:36.333
And we can't just keep putting
Band-Aids on every cut.

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.333
It's not a responsible
way to govern.

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.600
There's only one way to
truly fix the sequester:

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.233
by replacing it before it
causes further damage.

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:47.734
A couple weeks ago, I put
forward a budget that replaces

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:50.667
the next several years of these
dumb cuts with smarter cuts;

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:53.433
reforms our tax code to close
wasteful special interest

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:57.000
loopholes; and invests in
things like education, research,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.567
and manufacturing that will
create new jobs right now.

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:03.000
So I hope Members of Congress
will find the same sense of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.967
urgency and bipartisan
cooperation to help the families

00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:08.800
still in the crosshairs
of these cuts.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.533
Members of Congress may not feel
the pain felt by kids kicked off

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:15.467
of Head Start, or the 750,000
Americans projected to lose

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:17.367
their jobs because
of these cuts,

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:20.767
or the long-term unemployed who
will be further hurt by them.

00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:22.734
But that pain is real.

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:25.033
The American people worked
too hard, for too long,

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:28.700
rebuilding from one economic
crisis just to see your elected

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.266
officials keep causing more.

00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:32.934
Our economy is growing.

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:34.834
And our deficits are shrinking.

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:37.200
We're creating jobs
on a consistent basis.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.767
But we need to do more to help
middle-class families get ahead,

00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:43.200
and give more folks a chance
to earn their way into the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.800
middle class.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.700
We can, if we work together.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.100
That's what you expect.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.767
And that's what I'm going to
keep on working on every single

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:53.700
day to help deliver.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.166
Thanks so much.
