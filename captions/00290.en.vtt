00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:09.158
As we spend time with family and
friends this Labor Day weekend,

00:00:09.158 --> 00:00:13.291
many of us will also be thinking
about the state of working America.

00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:16.258
Yesterday, we received a report
showing that job losses have

00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:20.024
slowed dramatically compared
to just a few months ago.

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:22.525
Earlier in the week, we learned
that the manufacturing sector

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:25.325
has posted its first
gains in 18 months,

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.658
and that many of the banks that
borrowed money at the height of

00:00:27.658 --> 00:00:33.325
the financial crisis are now
returning it to taxpayers with interest.

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:35.425
These are only the most recent
signs that the economy is

00:00:35.425 --> 00:00:38.391
turning around, though these
signs are little comfort to

00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:41.058
those who've experienced the
pain of losing a job in the

00:00:41.058 --> 00:00:45.258
previous month, or in the
previous two years of this recession.

00:00:45.258 --> 00:00:47.658
That's why it's so important
that we remain focused on

00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:50.191
speeding our economic recovery.

00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:52.892
Throughout America today,
tens of thousands of recovery

00:00:52.892 --> 00:00:56.658
projects are underway, repairing
our nation's roads, bridges,

00:00:56.658 --> 00:01:00.124
ports and waterways;
renovating schools;

00:01:00.124 --> 00:01:02.258
and developing renewable energy.

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:05.591
We're putting Americans back
to work doing the work America

00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:09.692
needs done -- and mostly
in private sector jobs.

00:01:09.692 --> 00:01:12.024
But even as we take aggressive
steps to put people back to

00:01:12.024 --> 00:01:15.091
work, it's also important that
we keep faith with men and women

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:17.658
looking back on a
lifetime of labor;

00:01:17.658 --> 00:01:20.291
hard-working Americans who
deserve to know that their

00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:22.825
efforts have resulted
in a secure future,

00:01:22.825 --> 00:01:25.224
including a secure retirement.

00:01:25.224 --> 00:01:27.792
For this recession has not
only led to the loss of jobs,

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:30.258
but also the loss of savings.

00:01:30.258 --> 00:01:31.958
The drop in home
values, for example,

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.458
has also meant a drop in the
value of the single largest

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:37.825
investment most families have.

00:01:37.825 --> 00:01:40.458
And the decline in the financial
markets has led to a decline in

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:43.658
the value of 401(k)s and
other sources of savings and

00:01:43.658 --> 00:01:45.558
retirement security.

00:01:45.558 --> 00:01:47.792
As a result, over
the past two years,

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:53.258
the American people have lost
about $2 trillion in retirement savings.

00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:55.391
This carries a painful toll.

00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:58.358
I've heard from so many who've
had to put off retirement,

00:01:58.358 --> 00:02:01.425
or come out of retirement,
to make ends meet.

00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:03.692
I've heard from seniors who
worked hard their whole lives

00:02:03.692 --> 00:02:07.425
but now, in their golden years,
are unsure of where to turn to

00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:10.058
pay the bills, afford
the prescriptions,

00:02:10.058 --> 00:02:13.091
or keep the home in which
they raised a family.

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.792
And having too little in
savings not only leaves people

00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:18.124
financially ill-prepared
for retirement,

00:02:18.124 --> 00:02:21.124
but also for whatever
challenges life brings.

00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:23.358
It places in jeopardy
so many dreams,

00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:26.191
from owning a home
to attending college.

00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:29.391
The fact is, even before
this recession hit,

00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:31.825
the savings rate was
essentially zero,

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:35.591
while borrowing had risen and
credit card debt had increased.

00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:38.024
Many were simply struggling
to stay afloat as incomes were

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:41.425
stagnant -- or falling
-- and jobs were scarce;

00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:43.191
that's important to remember.

00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:45.925
But there were also those
who spent beyond their means.

00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:49.024
And more broadly, tens of
millions of families have been,

00:02:49.024 --> 00:02:52.291
for a variety of reasons, unable
to put away enough money for a

00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.024
secure retirement.

00:02:54.024 --> 00:02:56.991
Half of America's workforce
doesn't have access to a

00:02:56.991 --> 00:02:59.024
retirement plan at work.

00:02:59.024 --> 00:03:02.058
And fewer than 10% of those without workplace retirement

00:03:02.058 --> 00:03:04.425
plans have one of their own.

00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:06.458
We cannot continue
on this course.

00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:09.558
And we certainly can't go back
to an economy based on inflated

00:03:09.558 --> 00:03:11.825
profits and maxed-out
credit cards;

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:15.058
the cycles of speculative
boom and painful busts;

00:03:15.058 --> 00:03:17.658
a system that put the interests
of the short-term ahead of the

00:03:17.658 --> 00:03:19.792
needs of long-term.

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:24.158
We have to revive this economy
and rebuild it stronger than before.

00:03:24.158 --> 00:03:27.024
And making sure that folks have
the opportunity and incentive to

00:03:27.024 --> 00:03:32.224
save -- for a home or college, for retirement or a rainy day --

00:03:32.224 --> 00:03:34.191
is essential to that effort.

00:03:34.191 --> 00:03:36.792
If you work hard and meet
your responsibilities,

00:03:36.792 --> 00:03:39.858
this country is going to honor
our collective responsibility to

00:03:39.858 --> 00:03:44.525
you: to ensure that you can
save and secure your retirement.

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:47.124
That's why we're announcing
several common-sense changes

00:03:47.124 --> 00:03:51.058
that will help families put
away money for the future.

00:03:51.058 --> 00:03:53.692
First, we're going to make it
easier for small businesses to

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:57.358
do what large businesses do:
allow workers to automatically

00:03:57.358 --> 00:04:02.158
enroll in a 401(k) or an individual retirement account.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:04.224
We know that automatic
enrollment has made a big

00:04:04.224 --> 00:04:07.291
difference in participation
rates by making it simpler for

00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:10.525
workers to save -- and that's why we're going to expand it to

00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:12.191
more people.

00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:15.491
Second, we'll make it easier for
people to save their federal tax

00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:19.258
refunds, which 100
million families receive.

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:20.758
Today, if you have a
retirement account,

00:04:20.758 --> 00:04:24.825
you can have your refund
deposited directly into your account.

00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:27.291
With this change, we'll make
it easier for those without

00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:30.625
retirement plans to save
their refunds as well.

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:33.858
You'll be able to check a box on
your tax return to receive your

00:04:33.858 --> 00:04:36.725
refund as a savings bond.

00:04:36.725 --> 00:04:39.792
Third, we'll make it possible
for employees to put payments

00:04:39.792 --> 00:04:44.325
for unused vacation and sick
days into their retirement plans

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.792
if they wish.

00:04:45.792 --> 00:04:48.425
Right now, most workers
don't have that option.

00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:51.391
And fourth, the IRS and the
Treasury Department are creating

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:55.158
a plain-English, easy-to-follow
guide, as well as a website,

00:04:55.158 --> 00:04:58.892
to help folks navigate what are
often very complicated waters,

00:04:58.892 --> 00:05:02.958
especially for workers changing
jobs who often are unsure how

00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.758
best to continue
saving for retirement.

00:05:05.758 --> 00:05:08.091
Because the rules ought to be
written to encourage people to

00:05:08.091 --> 00:05:10.958
save -- instead of
discouraging them.

00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.825
We'll also build on these
steps by working with Congress.

00:05:13.825 --> 00:05:16.191
As part of my budget, I've
proposed ensuring that nearly

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:19.391
every American has access to
a retirement savings account

00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:21.291
through his or her job.

00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:24.158
This plan would make it possible
for workers to automatically

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:27.758
enroll in IRAs through
payroll contributions.

00:05:27.758 --> 00:05:30.224
And the budget simplifies
and expands a tax credit for

00:05:30.224 --> 00:05:34.058
millions of families, matching
half of a family's savings up to

00:05:34.058 --> 00:05:38.425
$1,000 per year and depositing
the tax credit directly into a

00:05:38.425 --> 00:05:40.291
retirement account.

00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:42.191
This is a difficult
time for our country.

00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:45.024
But I'm confident that we can
meet the challenges we face and

00:05:45.024 --> 00:05:47.692
leave behind something better;
that we're ready to take

00:05:47.692 --> 00:05:50.191
responsibility for our
future once again --

00:05:50.191 --> 00:05:52.758
as individuals and as a nation.

00:05:52.758 --> 00:05:55.258
I hope that all of you have the
chance to enjoy this Labor Day

00:05:55.258 --> 00:05:57.224
weekend with family and friends.

00:05:57.224 --> 00:06:00.191
But my larger hope and
expectation is that next Labor

00:06:00.191 --> 00:06:03.658
Day, the economic storms we're
weathering now will have given

00:06:03.658 --> 00:06:07.091
way to brighter and
more prosperous times.

00:06:07.091 --> 00:06:08.091
Thank you.
