00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:11.544
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.580
This week, I'm speaking
to you from our

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.615
Nuclear Security Summit.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.617
I welcomed more than 50
leaders from around the

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:20.453
world to make sure we're
working together to meet one

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:23.289
of the greatest threats to
global security - terrorists

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.359
getting their hands on a
weapon of mass destruction,

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.361
like a nuclear weapon.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.230
Fortunately, because
of our efforts so far,

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.465
no terrorist group has yet
succeeded in obtaining a

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:35.135
nuclear device or producing
a dirty bomb using

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.903
radioactive materials.

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:38.905
But we know that
al Qaeda has tried.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.775
ISIL has already used
chemical weapons in Syria

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:42.776
and Iraq.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.745
And if they ever got hold of
a nuclear weapon or nuclear

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:48.948
material, we have no
doubt they'd use it.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.950
That's why we've been
leading a global effort to

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.952
secure the world's
nuclear materials.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.220
And with summits like
this,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.089
we've made important progress.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.425
Working with other nations,
we have removed or secured

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:01.294
enough nuclear material
for more than 150 nuclear

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:04.531
weapons - material that will
now never fall into the

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:06.433
hands of terrorists.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.435
All of South America is
now free

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.736
of these deadly materials.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.972
Central Europe and Southeast
Asia are on track to be free

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:14.841
of them later this year.

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.843
That means that as
terrorists and criminal

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:18.845
gangs look around for the
deadly ingredients for a

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:22.515
nuclear device, vast regions
of the world are now off limits.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.884
This is a remarkable
achievement.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.086
And at this summit, we
pledged to keep up our

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.956
efforts to prevent the
world's most deadly networks

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:33.092
from obtaining the world's
most deadly weapons.

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:35.295
Our summit was also another
opportunity to make sure the

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:38.731
world remains united and
focused on destroying ISIL.

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.900
A majority of the nations
who came here are part of

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.403
our global coalition
against ISIL.

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.405
A number of our countries
have been targeted by ISIL.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:49.142
Just about all our nations
have seen citizens travel to

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:52.412
join ISIL in Syria and Iraq.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:55.682
In Syria and Iraq, ISIL
continues to lose ground.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.151
Our coalition continues
to take out its leaders,

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:00.253
including those planning
terrorist attacks against

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:01.554
our countries.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.691
They're losing their oil
infrastructure and revenues.

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:05.892
Their morale is suffering.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:09.329
As ISIL is squeezed
in Syria and Iraq,

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.931
it's lashing out elsewhere,
as we've seen most recently-

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:15.535
and tragically-from
Turkey to Brussels.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.704
During our summit, we
focused on ways to step up

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:20.306
our efforts to disrupt
terrorist attacks.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.709
It requires even more
cooperation to prevent the

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.178
flow of foreign terrorist
fighters and sharing even

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:27.514
more information
and intelligence.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.883
That's why I invited all the
nations represented at this

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.385
summit to join us in a
broader discussion among our

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:35.054
intelligence and security
services on how we can

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:39.392
improve information sharing
to prevent terrorist attacks.

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:41.394
This continues to be
a difficult fight.

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:44.664
But every day, our dedicated
professionals - military,

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.366
diplomatic, intelligence,
counterterrorism,

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:49.469
homeland security,
law enforcement,

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.906
nuclear experts-are
working to protect us.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:54.908
Because of the progress
we made this week,

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:57.143
and over recent years, more
of the world's nuclear

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:58.978
material is secure.

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:01.848
It's harder for
terrorists to get it.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.850
And as Commander in Chief, I
want you to know that we're

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.919
going to keep doing
everything in our power to

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.988
keep our nation safe
and strong and free.
