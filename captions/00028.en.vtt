00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:11.845
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:15.682
Today, September 26th, is
"National Prescription

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.284
Drug Take-Back Day."

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:21.121
It's a day where you can
safely, conveniently,

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.057
and responsibly dispose
of expired and unwanted

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.493
prescription drugs
at collection sites

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.328
in your community.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.363
Here's why this matters.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:34.501
More Americans now die every
year from drug overdoses than

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.970
they do in car crashes.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.439
And most of those deaths
aren't due to drugs like

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:44.477
cocaine or heroin - but
rather prescription drugs.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:48.748
In 2013 alone, overdoses
from prescription pain

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:52.952
medications killed more
than 16,000 Americans.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:56.055
And most young people who begin
misusing prescription drugs

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:58.792
don't buy them in some
dark alley - they get them

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:01.661
from the medicine cabinet.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.663
If that's not a good enough
reason to participate in

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:07.167
"National Prescription Drug
Take-Back Day," here's another.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:09.235
Many prescription pain
medications belong

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.605
to the same class
of drugs as heroin.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:16.910
In fact, four in five heroin
users started out by misusing

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.845
prescription drugs.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:24.417
And over the course of just one
year, between 2013 and 2014,

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:30.824
we saw a 33% increase in
the number of heroin users.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.960
All of this takes a terrible
toll on too many families,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.796
in too many communities, all
across the country - big

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:39.265
and small, urban and rural.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:42.335
It strains law enforcement
and treatment programs.

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:46.573
It costs all of us - in
so many different ways.

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:49.409
That's why, four years ago,
my Administration unveiled

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.212
a Prescription Drug
Abuse Prevention Plan.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.214
We've been partnering with
communities to combat

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:57.684
overdoses, and we're seeing
some promising results.

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:59.986
That's why the budget I put
forward this year would

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:01.054
build on those efforts.

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:03.690
It would make critical
investments in things like

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.893
drug monitoring programs,
equipping more first responders

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:10.463
to save more lives, and
expanding medication-assisted

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:13.933
treatment programs -
including in our prisons.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.369
In fact, getting smarter about
how we address substance

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.072
use disorders is a vital
part of reforming our

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.907
criminal justice system.

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:22.976
Rather than keep spending
billions of taxpayer

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.812
dollars on needlessly
long prison sentences for

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.614
nonviolent drug offenders,

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:29.749
we could save money and
get better outcomes

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.418
by getting treatment
to those who need it.

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:35.255
And we could use some of the
savings to make sure the brave

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:38.057
men and women of law
enforcement have the resources

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:41.394
they need to go after drug
kingpins and violent gangs,

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:43.930
disrupt the flow of
drugs into our country,

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.934
and address the real
threats to our communities.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.103
With no other disease do
we expect people to wait

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.171
until they're a
danger to themselves

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:55.642
or others to self-diagnose
and seek treatment.

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:59.412
So we should approach abuse as
an opportunity to intervene,

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:00.413
not incarcerate.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:03.416
And we all have a
role to play here.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:05.885
Parents, we have to
understand how important

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:07.921
it is to talk to our
kids, and to safely

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.623
store medications
in the house.

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:12.625
The medical community
has to be engaged,

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.861
too - because better
prescribing practices

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.796
will make a difference.

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:19.966
And as a country, we have to
keep working to reduce drug

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:22.835
use through evidence-based
treatment, prevention,

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:24.304
and recovery.

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:27.073
Because research
shows it works.

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:32.078
Courageous Americans
show it works, every day.

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:34.681
That's why the man I named to
head the office of National

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:37.784
Drug Control Policy -
Michael Botticelli -

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:40.019
is a man in long-term
recovery himself.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.488
He talks about it
openly and honestly,

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:45.625
precisely to strike down the
shame and stigma that too

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:50.229
often keep people from seeking
care before it's too late.

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.231
This is something I'll
be talking about more

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:54.434
in the weeks to come, in
communities across the country.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:59.539
Because it's a challenge we
can solve if we work together.

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.641
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
