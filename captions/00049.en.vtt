The President: Hi
everybody.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.080
I'm speaking with you from
the D.C. Public Library

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.617
in Anacostia, where I just
met with a group of promising

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:19.586
middle school students.

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:21.621
We spent some time talking
about their lives,

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:24.758
and how we all care about
their success - and how that

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:27.427
starts with a
good education.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.763
So one thing I announced
here in Anacostia is a new

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:33.066
project by libraries and
major publishers to provide

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:38.037
more than $250 million in
free e-Books for low-income

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:39.472
students.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:42.108
We also issued a challenge
to mayors, libraries,

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:45.111
and school leaders to help
every student get a library

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.580
card, so they can
expand their horizons

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.516
in a place like this.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:52.185
It's all part of our
ConnectED initiative

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:55.188
to connect 99 percent 
of America's students

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:56.956
to high-speed Internet.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:59.192
Because no matter who
you are, where you live,

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:00.827
or how much
money you've got,

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:02.996
you should be able to access
the world's knowledge

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:05.799
and information just
like anyone else.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.001
In a global economy, we've
got to help ensure that

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.004
everyone, of every age,
in every zip code - urban

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:14.007
and rural - has the chance to
learn the skills that lead

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.042
directly to a good job.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:18.545
That's also why I've put
forward a plan to make

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:21.181
two years of community college
as free and universal for

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.083
every American as
high school is today.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:26.085
It's something I'll talk
about in my commencement

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:28.087
address next week
at Lake Area Tech,

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:30.957
in the small town of
Watertown, South Dakota.

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:33.092
It's a community college
with a graduation rate that

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:36.262
is nearly twice the
national average.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.832
They're proving that a great
education can be within

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:40.900
everyone's reach.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.902
All of us have a
responsibility to not only

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:45.738
make sure our own children
have pathways to success

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.140
but that all children do.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.877
And a great education is the
ticket to a better life like

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:52.412
never before.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:55.014
Making sure all our kids
receive one is the surest

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.750
way to show them that
their lives matter.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.752
And it's the smartest way
to prove to them that

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:03.122
in communities like this,
and in a country like ours,

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:06.493
we believe in
opportunity for all.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:07.427
Thanks, everybody.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:08.294
And have a great weekend.
