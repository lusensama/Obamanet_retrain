00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.934
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:15.567
At a time when our businesses
have created 9.2 million new

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:18.700
jobs in just over four years,
and more companies are

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.033
considering bringing
jobs back from overseas,

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:23.333
we have a choice to make.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.900
We can make it easier for
businesses to invest in America

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.000
- or we can make it harder.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.900
I want to work with
Congress to create jobs

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.300
and opportunity for
more Americans.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.734
But where Congress
won't act, I will.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:39.533
And I want to talk about three
things we're doing right now.

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.633
First, we're helping more
businesses bring jobs

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:44.800
to America from overseas.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.500
Three years ago, my
Administration created SelectUSA

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.967
- a team of people in embassies
abroad and agencies here

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:55.834
at home focused on insourcing
instead of outsourcing.

00:00:55.834 --> 00:01:00.100
Today, they're helping a Belgian
company create jobs in Oklahoma.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.266
They're helping a Canadian
company create jobs in Kansas.

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.600
In my State of
the Union Address,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.300
I asked more businesses
to do their part.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.000
And this week, business leaders
from across the country are

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.934
coming here to the White House
to discuss new investments

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:15.767
that will create even more jobs.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.467
Second, on Thursday, I'll
be heading to Cooperstown,

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:22.433
New York - home of the
Baseball Hall of Fame -

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:24.600
to talk about tourism.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.433
Because believe it or not,
tourism is an export.

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:30.400
And if we make it easier for
more foreign visitors to visit

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.500
and spend money at America's
attractions and unparalleled

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.767
national parks, that helps
local businesses and grows

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:38.967
the economy for everyone.

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:42.567
Finally, we know that investing
in first-class infrastructure

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:44.834
attracts first-class jobs.

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:46.100
And I want to spend
a minute on this,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.200
because it's very
important this year.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.133
We know business owners don't
seek out crumbling roads

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.600
and bridges and
backed-up supply chains.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.800
They set up shop
where the newest,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.633
fastest transportation and
communications networks

00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:01.834
let them invent and sell
goods Made in America

00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:04.467
to the rest of the world
as fast as possible.

00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:07.433
Here's the problem: If
Congress doesn't act

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:09.934
by the end of this
summer, federal funding

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:12.967
for transportation
projects will run out.

00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:15.967
States might have to put some
of their projects on hold.

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:18.400
In fact, some already are,
because they're worried

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.433
Congress won't clear
up its own gridlock.

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:24.834
And if Congress fails
to act, nearly 700,000

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:28.100
jobs would be at
risk over the next year.

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:30.533
That's why I put forward
a plan to rebuild our

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:34.467
transportation infrastructure
in a more responsible way.

00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:37.367
It would support millions
of jobs across the country.

00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:40.834
And we'd pay for it without
adding to the deficit by closing

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:43.333
wasteful tax loopholes
for companies that ship

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:45.433
jobs overseas.

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:47.300
Now, the Republicans in
Congress seem to have

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.433
very different priorities.

00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:52.033
Not only have they neglected
to prevent this funding from

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:56.266
running out, their proposal
would actually cut by 80%

00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:59.834
a job-creating grant program
that has funded high-priority

00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:03.400
transportation projects
in all 50 states.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.266
And they can't say
it's to save money,

00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:07.967
because at the very same time,
they voted for trillions

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:11.033
of dollars in new tax cuts,
weighted towards those

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:12.633
at the very top.

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:15.233
Think about that.

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:17.600
Instead of putting people to
work on projects that would grow

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.100
the economy for everyone, they
voted to give a huge tax cut

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.633
to households making more
than $1 million a year.

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:27.767
So while Congress decides
what it's going to do,

00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:29.867
I'll keep doing what
I can on my own.

00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:32.600
On Wednesday, I was in New York
where workers are building

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.700
the area's first large new
bridge in 50 years.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.100
And they're doing it
ahead of schedule.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.166
Three years ago, I took action
without Congress to fast-track

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:43.467
the permitting process
for major projects.

00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:46.033
Normally, it would have
taken three to five years

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:48.300
to permit that bridge.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.500
We did it in a year and a half.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.500
And I announced a new plan to
cut red tape and speed up the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.400
process for even more
projects across the country.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.700
All these steps will make
it easier for businesses

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.467
to invest in America and create
more good jobs.

00:04:03.467 --> 00:04:05.600
All of them can be
done without Congress.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.033
But we could do a lot more if
Congress was willing to help.

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:12.266
In the meantime, I'll do
whatever I can - not just

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:14.633
to make America a better
place to do business,

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:17.400
but to make sure
hard work pays off,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.500
and opportunity is open to all.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.800
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
