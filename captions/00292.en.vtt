00:00:12.828 --> 00:00:14.561
The President:
Each and every day
in this country,

00:00:14.561 --> 00:00:17.394
Americans are grappling with
health care premiums that are

00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:20.461
growing three times the rate
of wages and insurance company

00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:24.561
policies that limit coverage
and raise out-of-pocket costs.

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:28.294
Thousands are losing their
insurance coverage each day.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:31.861
Without real reform, the burdens
on America's families and

00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:34.628
businesses will
continue to multiply.

00:00:34.628 --> 00:00:37.394
We've had a vigorous debate
about health insurance reform,

00:00:37.394 --> 00:00:39.161
and rightly so.

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:41.961
This is an issue of vital
concern to every American,

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:44.494
and I'm glad that
so many are engaged.

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:47.194
But it also should
be an honest debate,

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:50.795
not one dominated by willful
misrepresentations and outright

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:54.728
distortions, spread by the very
folks who would benefit the most

00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:57.895
by keeping things
exactly as they are.

00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:00.994
So today, I want to spend a few
minutes debunking some of the

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:04.161
more outrageous myths
circulating on the internet,

00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:09.094
on cable TV, and repeated at some town halls across this country.

00:01:09.094 --> 00:01:12.261
Let's start with the false claim
that illegal immigrants will get

00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:14.227
health insurance under reform.

00:01:14.227 --> 00:01:15.795
That's not true.

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:18.094
Illegal immigrants
would not be covered.

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:21.861
That idea has never
even been on the table.

00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:24.227
Some are also saying that
coverage for abortions would be

00:01:24.227 --> 00:01:26.161
mandated under reform.

00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:27.695
Also false.

00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:30.328
When it comes to the current
ban on using tax dollars for

00:01:30.328 --> 00:01:34.261
abortions, nothing will
change under reform.

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:38.061
And as every credible person
who has looked into it has said,

00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:40.795
there are no so-called
"death panels" --

00:01:40.795 --> 00:01:43.895
an offensive notion to me
and to the American people.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.661
These are phony claims
meant to divide us.

00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:50.261
And we've all heard the charge
that reform will somehow bring

00:01:50.261 --> 00:01:52.928
about a government
takeover of health care.

00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:54.861
I know that sounds
scary to many folks.

00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:56.795
It sounds scary to me, too.

00:01:56.795 --> 00:01:59.795
But here's the
thing: it's not true.

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:03.294
I no sooner want government to
get between you and your doctor

00:02:03.294 --> 00:02:06.294
than I want insurance companies
to make arbitrary decisions

00:02:06.294 --> 00:02:10.628
about what medical care is
best for you, as they do today.

00:02:10.628 --> 00:02:13.828
As I've said from the beginning,
under the reform we seek,

00:02:13.828 --> 00:02:17.227
if you like your doctor,
you can keep your doctor.

00:02:17.227 --> 00:02:20.027
If you like your private
health insurance plan,

00:02:20.027 --> 00:02:22.227
you can keep your plan.

00:02:22.227 --> 00:02:23.895
Period.

00:02:23.895 --> 00:02:26.061
Now, the source of a lot of
these fears about government-run

00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:30.094
health care is confusion over
what's called the public option.

00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:34.061
This is one idea among many to
provide more competition and

00:02:34.061 --> 00:02:37.928
choice, especially in the many
places around the country where

00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:41.761
just one insurer thoroughly
dominates the marketplace.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:45.361
This alternative would have to
operate as any other insurer,

00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:48.161
on the basis of the
premiums it collects.

00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:51.394
And let me repeat -- it
would just be an option;

00:02:51.394 --> 00:02:54.428
those who prefer their private insurers would be under no

00:02:54.428 --> 00:02:57.328
obligation to shift
to a public plan.

00:02:57.328 --> 00:02:59.227
The insurance companies and
their allies don't like this

00:02:59.227 --> 00:03:02.795
idea, or any that would
promote greater competition.

00:03:02.795 --> 00:03:04.061
I get that.

00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:06.661
And I expect there would be a
lot of discussion about it when

00:03:06.661 --> 00:03:08.628
Congress returns.

00:03:08.628 --> 00:03:11.361
But this one aspect of the
health care debate shouldn't

00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:15.261
overshadow the other important
steps we can and must take to

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:19.494
reduce the increasing burdens
families and businesses face.

00:03:19.494 --> 00:03:23.161
So let me stress them again:
If you don't have insurance,

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:27.261
you will finally have access to
quality coverage you can afford.

00:03:27.261 --> 00:03:31.027
If you do have coverage, you
will benefit from more security

00:03:31.027 --> 00:03:34.094
and more stability when it
comes to your insurance.

00:03:34.094 --> 00:03:37.494
If you move, lose your
job, or change jobs,

00:03:37.494 --> 00:03:40.761
you will not have to worry
about losing health coverage.

00:03:40.761 --> 00:03:43.861
And we will set up tough
consumer protections that will

00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:47.061
hold insurance companies
accountable and stop them from

00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:50.361
exploiting you with
unfair practices.

00:03:50.361 --> 00:03:52.695
We'll prohibit insurance
companies from denying coverage

00:03:52.695 --> 00:03:55.127
because of a person's
medical history.

00:03:55.127 --> 00:03:58.261
They will not be able to drop
your coverage if you get sick.

00:03:58.261 --> 00:04:01.994
They will not be able to water
down your coverage when you need it most.

00:04:01.994 --> 00:04:05.194
They will no longer be able to
place some arbitrary cap on the

00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:10.127
amount of coverage you can
receive in a given year or a lifetime.

00:04:10.127 --> 00:04:12.461
We'll place a limit on how
much you can be charged for

00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:15.994
out-of-pocket expenses, because
no one in America should go

00:04:15.994 --> 00:04:18.761
broke because they get sick.

00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:21.695
And we will require insurance
companies to cover routine

00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:25.961
checkups and preventive
care, like mammograms and colonoscopies.

00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:28.661
There's no reason we shouldn't
be catching diseases like breast

00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:32.194
cancer and colon cancer
on the front end.

00:04:32.194 --> 00:04:34.428
That makes sense,
it saves lives,

00:04:34.428 --> 00:04:37.661
and it will also save
money over the long-run.

00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:40.561
Taken together, the reforms
we're seeking will help bring

00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:44.027
down skyrocketing costs, which
will mean real savings for

00:04:44.027 --> 00:04:47.661
families, businesses,
and government.

00:04:47.661 --> 00:04:51.461
We know what a failure to act
would bring: More of the same.

00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:53.494
More of the same
exploding costs.

00:04:53.494 --> 00:04:55.928
More of the same
diminished coverage.

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:59.094
If we fail to act,
the crisis will grow.

00:04:59.094 --> 00:05:01.194
More families will
go without coverage.

00:05:01.194 --> 00:05:05.328
More businesses will be forced
to drop or water down their plans.

00:05:05.328 --> 00:05:08.161
So we can push off the day of
reckoning and fail to deal with

00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:11.094
the flaws in the system,
just as Washington has done,

00:05:11.094 --> 00:05:13.761
year after year,
decade after decade.

00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:17.194
Or we can take steps that will
provide every American family

00:05:17.194 --> 00:05:20.528
and business a measure of
security and stability that they

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:22.461
lack today.

00:05:22.461 --> 00:05:25.127
It's never been easy,
moving this nation forward.

00:05:25.127 --> 00:05:27.227
There are always
those who oppose it,

00:05:27.227 --> 00:05:29.828
and those who use
fear to block change.

00:05:29.828 --> 00:05:32.361
But what has always
distinguished America is that

00:05:32.361 --> 00:05:34.494
when all the arguments
have been heard,

00:05:34.494 --> 00:05:36.494
and all the concerns
have been voiced,

00:05:36.494 --> 00:05:39.361
and the time comes to
do what must be done,

00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:43.194
we rise above our differences,
grasp each others' hands,

00:05:43.194 --> 00:05:46.695
and march forward as one
nation and one people,

00:05:46.695 --> 00:05:49.728
some of us Democrats,
some of us Republicans,

00:05:49.728 --> 00:05:52.161
all of us Americans.

00:05:52.161 --> 00:05:54.361
This is our chance
to march forward.

00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:57.661
I can't promise you that the
reforms we seek will be perfect

00:05:57.661 --> 00:05:59.628
or make a difference overnight.

00:05:59.628 --> 00:06:03.428
But I can promise you this: if
we pass health insurance reform,

00:06:03.428 --> 00:06:06.328
we will look back many
years from now and say,

00:06:06.328 --> 00:06:10.227
this was the moment we summoned
what's best in each of us to

00:06:10.227 --> 00:06:12.628
make life better for all of us.

00:06:12.628 --> 00:06:15.161
This was the moment when we
built a health care system

00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:18.394
worthy of the nation
and the people we love.

00:06:18.394 --> 00:06:22.428
This was the moment we earned
our place alongside the greatest generations.

00:06:22.428 --> 00:06:27.261
And that is what our generation
of Americans is called to do right now.
