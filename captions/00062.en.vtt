00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.078
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:14.047
This week, in my State
of the Union Address,

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.849
I talked about what we
can do to make sure

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.851
middle-class
economics helps more

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.820
Americans get ahead
in the new economy.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.523
See, after some tough
years, and thanks

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:26.159
to some tough decisions
we made, our economy

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:30.697
is creating jobs at the
fastest pace since 1999.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.732
Our deficits
are shrinking.

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:35.135
Our energy production
is booming.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.370
Our troops are coming home.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.039
Thanks to the hard work and
resilience of Americans

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.176
like you, we've risen from
recession freer to write

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:47.180
our own future than any
other nation on Earth.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.249
Now we have to choose
what we want that future

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.817
to look like.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.819
Will we accept an
economy where only

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.821
a few of us do
spectacularly well?

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:57.123
Or will we commit
ourselves to an economy

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.392
that generates rising
incomes and rising

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:03.463
chances for everyone
who makes the effort?

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.732
I believe the
choice is clear.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.734
Today, thanks to
a growing economy,

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.236
the recovery is touching
more and more lives.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.772
Wages are finally
starting to rise again.

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:15.608
Let's keep that going -
let's do more to restore

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:18.778
the link between hard work
and growing opportunity

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:21.381
for every American.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:24.484
That's what middle-class
economics is - the idea that

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:27.654
this country does best when
everyone gets their fair shot,

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:30.790
everyone does their fair
share, and everyone plays

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.892
by the same set of rules.

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:35.261
Middle-class economics means
helping workers feel more

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.665
secure in a world of constant
change - making it easier

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:43.136
to afford childcare, college,
paid leave, health care,

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:45.572
a home, and retirement.

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.574
Middle-class economics
means doing more to help

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:49.909
Americans upgrade their skills
through opportunities like

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.379
apprenticeships and two years
of free community college,

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:57.116
so we can keep earning
higher wages down the road.

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:59.252
Middle-class economics
means building the most

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:02.222
competitive economy in the
world, by building the best

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:05.058
infrastructure, opening new
markets so we can sell our

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:08.761
products around the world,
and investing in research -

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:12.832
so that businesses keep
creating good jobs right here.

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:15.702
And we can afford to do these
things by closing loopholes

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:18.905
in our tax code that stack the
decks for special interests

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:22.775
and the superrich, and
against responsible companies

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:23.776
and the middle class.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:27.213
This is where we have to go
if we're going to succeed

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:29.115
in the new economy.

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.117
I know that there are
Republicans in Congress

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:33.653
who disagree with my approach,
and I look forward to hearing

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.689
their ideas for how we can
pay for what the middle class

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.324
needs to grow.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.927
But what we can't do is
simply pretend that things

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:43.563
like child care or
college aren't important,

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:46.032
or pretend there's nothing we
can do to help middle class

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:48.167
families get ahead.

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:50.503
Because we've
got work to do.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.506
As a country, we have made
it through some hard times.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.842
But we've laid a
new foundation.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.844
We've got a new
future to write.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:59.312
And I'm eager to
get to work.

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.047
Thanks everybody, and
have a great weekend.
