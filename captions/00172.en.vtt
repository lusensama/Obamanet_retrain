00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.066
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.133
Four years after the worst
economic crisis of our

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:12.000
lifetimes, we're seeing
signs that, as a nation,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.867
we're moving forward again.

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:17.767
After losing about 800,000 jobs
a month when I took office,

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:21.767
our businesses have now added
5.2 million new jobs over the

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:23.533
past two and a half years.

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.000
And on Friday, we learned that
the unemployment rate is now at

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.667
its lowest level
since I took office.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:30.834
More Americans are
entering the workforce.

00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:33.467
More Americans are getting jobs.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:35.800
But too many of our friends and
neighbors are still looking for

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.967
work or struggling
to pay the bills --

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:41.166
many of them since long
before this crisis hit.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.767
We owe it to them to
keep moving forward.

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:45.800
We've come too far
to turn back now.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.000
We've made too much progress to
return to the policies that got

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
us into this mess
in the first place.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.867
For example -- two years ago,
we put in place tougher,

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:56.767
common sense rules of the road
for Wall Street to make sure

00:00:56.767 --> 00:00:59.467
that the kind of crisis we've
been fighting back from never

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:01.266
happens again.

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.867
These rules mean that big banks
are no longer going to be able

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:06.266
to make risky bets
with your deposits.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.633
And if a big bank does make a
bad decision, they pay for it --

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.266
not taxpayers.

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:14.066
And we also put in place the
strongest consumer protections

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:17.133
in our history to crack down on
the worst practices of credit

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:20.000
card companies and
mortgage lenders.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.266
But for some reason, some
Republicans in Congress are

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:26.400
still waging an all-out battle
to delay, de-fund and dismantle

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.667
these common sense new rules.

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:30.000
Why?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.734
Do they think undoing rules that
protect families from the worst

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:35.400
practices of credit card
companies and mortgage lenders

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.800
will make the middle
class stronger?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.633
Do they think getting rid of
rules to prevent another crisis

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:44.000
on Wall Street will make
Main Street any safer?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.633
Republicans in Congress need
to stop trying to re-fight the

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:49.433
battles of the past few
years, and finally start doing

00:01:49.433 --> 00:01:52.900
something to actually help
the middle class get ahead.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.133
And here are three things
they can do right now.

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:59.467
First, Congress needs to step
up and guarantee that 98% of

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:03.266
Americans and 97% of small
business owners won't see their

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:05.433
taxes go up next year.

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:08.166
This is something that
everyone says they agree on.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.433
It should have gotten
done months ago.

00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:13.200
But Republicans in Congress
are standing in the way.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.000
They're holding tax cuts for 98%
of Americans hostage until we

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.600
pass tax cuts for the
wealthiest 2% of Americans.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.500
Ask them how that
helps the middle class.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.834
Second, Congress needs to step
up and provide every responsible

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:31.166
homeowner a chance to save about
$3,000 a year on their mortgage

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:33.600
by refinancing at lower rates.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.533
I gave them a plan to do
that -- back in February.

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:38.667
It's a plan that has the
support of independent,

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:41.066
nonpartisan economists
and leaders across the

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:42.533
housing industry.

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:45.667
But Republicans won't even
let that plan come to a vote.

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:48.333
Ask them how that
helps homeowners.

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:51.800
Third, Congress needs to step
up and pass my plan to create a

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.166
veterans jobs corps to help our
returning heroes find work as

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:58.367
cops, firefighters and park
rangers in communities across

00:02:58.367 --> 00:02:59.734
the country.

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:03.800
A few weeks ago, Republicans in
the Senate voted that plan down.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.233
Ask them why someone who fights
for this country abroad should

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:08.700
have to fight for a job
when they come home.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.266
In other words, ask them
to get back to work and get

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:12.734
these things done.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.033
If we're going to keep this
economy moving forward,

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:16.834
there's no time for
political games.

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:18.633
Even in a political season.

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:20.900
Everyone needs to do their part.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.367
If you agree with me, let
your Representative know

00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:24.900
where you stand.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.867
Tell them that if
they want your vote,

00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:29.133
then they need to stand with
you and not in the way of

00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:30.667
our recovery.

00:03:30.667 --> 00:03:32.667
Thanks and have a great weekend.
