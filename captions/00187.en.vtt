00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:08.433
The President:
This week, I spent some time
talking with college students

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:11.667
about how we can make higher
education more affordable.

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.233
And one of the things I told
them was how proud I was that

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:17.133
they were making that
investment in themselves --

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:20.233
because in today's economy, the
best predictor of success is a

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:21.867
good education.

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:24.500
That's not just true for
our individual success;

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.400
it's also true for
America's success.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.300
New jobs and new businesses will
take root wherever they can find

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.133
the most highly-educated,
highly-skilled workers.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.033
And I want those workers
to be American workers.

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:39.967
I want those good-paying,
middle-class jobs to take

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:41.934
root right here.

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:44.133
So it should concern
everybody that right now --

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.834
all across America -- tens
of thousands of teachers are

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:48.567
getting laid off.

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:51.734
In Pennsylvania alone, there
are 9,000 fewer educators in our

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:54.567
schools today than
just a year ago.

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:57.633
In Ohio, the number
is close to 7,000.

00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.467
And nationwide, over
the past three years,

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:04.133
school districts have lost
over 250,000 educators.

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.400
Think about what that
means for our country.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.166
When there are fewer
teachers in our schools,

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.433
class sizes start climbing up.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:12.767
Our students start
falling behind.

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:15.000
And our economy takes a hit.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.600
The point is: teachers matter.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.633
One study found that a good
teacher can increase the

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:23.867
lifetime income of a
classroom by over $250,000.

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:27.233
A great teacher can change
the course of a child's life.

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:29.800
So the last thing our country
needs is to have fewer teachers

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.433
in our schools.

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:34.567
Now, I know states are still
going through some tough times.

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:37.433
I realize that every Governor is
dealing with limited resources

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:41.100
and many face stark choices
when it comes to their budgets.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.900
But that doesn't mean we should
just stand by and do nothing.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.834
When states struggle, it's
up to Congress to step in

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:49.333
and help out.

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:53.900
In 2009 and in 2010, we provided
aid to states to keep hundreds

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.166
of thousands of teachers
in the classroom.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:57.967
But we need to do more.

00:01:57.967 --> 00:02:00.367
That's why a critical part of
the jobs bill that I sent to

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:04.066
Congress back in September was
to help states prevent even more

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:06.800
layoffs and rehire even
more teachers who had

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.934
lost their jobs.

00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:10.767
Of course, months later,
we're still waiting on

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:12.967
Congress to act.

00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:15.533
When it comes to this recovery,
we can't fully control

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:17.367
everything that happens in
other parts of the world.

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:20.100
But there are plenty of
things we can control.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.266
There are plenty of steps
we can take, right now,

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:24.100
to strengthen our economy.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.734
Putting teachers back in
our kids' classroom is one

00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:28.367
of those steps.

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:30.834
There's no excuse for inaction.

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:32.000
You work hard.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.600
Your leaders should, too.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.667
Especially at this make-or-break
moment for the middle class.

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:38.667
I know this is an election year.

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:41.200
But some things are
bigger than an election.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.333
Some things are
bigger than politics.

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:45.934
So I hope you'll join me in
telling Congress to do the right

00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:49.333
thing; to get to work and to
help get our teachers back in

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:50.734
the classroom.

00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:53.300
We can't afford to
wait any longer.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.300
Thanks and have a great weekend.
