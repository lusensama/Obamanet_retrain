00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.266
The President:
Over the past three years, we've
been clawing our way back from

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.300
the worst economic
crisis of our lifetimes.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.166
And we know it will take longer
than any of us would like to

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.533
fully recover all the jobs and
savings that have been lost.

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.400
But there are things we
can do -- right now --

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400
to help put people back to work
and make life a little easier

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.066
for middle-class families.

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.633
For months, I've been pushing
Congress to help us along by

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:30.166
passing common-sense policies
that would make a difference.

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.367
Democrats and Republicans have
already done some important work

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:34.900
together -- like passing a tax
cut that's allowing working

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.967
Americans to keep more of
their paychecks every week.

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:40.867
But Congress has refused to act
on most of the other ideas in my

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:44.300
jobs plan that economists
say could put a million more

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.567
Americans back to work.

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.467
There is no excuse for
this kind of inaction.

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:52.200
Right now, we are seven days
away from thousands of American

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.000
workers having to walk off the
job because Congress hasn't

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.200
passed a transportation bill.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.667
We're eight days away from
nearly seven and a half million

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:03.200
students seeing their loan rates
double because Congress hasn't

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.066
acted to stop it.

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.967
This makes no sense.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.333
We know that one of the most
important things we can do for

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.800
our economy is to make sure
that all Americans get the best

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.667
education possible.

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:16.133
Right now, the unemployment rate
for Americans with a college

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:19.700
degree or more is about
half the national average.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.600
Their incomes are twice as high
as those who don't have a high

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.200
school diploma.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.500
So, if we know that a higher
education is the clearest path

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.533
to the middle class, why would
we make it harder to achieve?

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:33.500
So much of America needs
to be repaired right now.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.667
Bridges are deteriorating
after years of neglect.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:38.834
Highways are choked
with congestion.

00:01:38.834 --> 00:01:41.367
Transportation delays cost
Americans and businesses

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.533
billions of dollars every year.

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.400
And there are hundreds of
thousands of construction

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.033
workers who have never been more
eager to get back on the job.

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:52.133
So why would we let our
transportation funding run out?

00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:55.066
This is a time when we should be
doing everything in our power --

00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:57.934
Democrats and Republicans
-- to keep this recovery

00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:00.100
moving forward.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.300
My Administration
is doing its part.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.533
On Friday, Secretary of
Transportation Ray LaHood

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:08.233
announced $500 million in
competitive grants for states

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:11.233
and communities that will create
construction jobs on projects

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:13.967
like road repair
and port renovation.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.734
And that's an important
step, but we can't do it all

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:18.300
on our own.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.900
The Senate did their part.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.867
They passed a bipartisan
transportation bill

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:23.166
back in March.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:27.500
It had the support of 52
Democrats and 22 Republicans.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.367
Now, it's up to the
House to follow suit;

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:33.200
to put aside partisan
posturing, end the gridlock,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.533
and do what's right for
the American people.

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:38.166
It's not lost on any of us
that this is an election year.

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:40.433
But we've got responsibilities
that are bigger than

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:41.934
an election.

00:02:41.934 --> 00:02:43.767
We answer to the
American people,

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:45.934
and they are demanding action.

00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:48.667
Let's make it easier for
students to stay in college.

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:51.033
Let's keep construction workers
rebuilding our roads

00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:52.033
and bridges.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:55.133
And let's tell Congress
to do their job.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.900
Tell them it's time to take
steps that we know will create

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.734
jobs now and help sustain our
economy for years to come.
