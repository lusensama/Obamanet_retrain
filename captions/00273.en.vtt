00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.300
The President:
On Monday, we
celebrate Labor Day.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.233
It's a chance to get together
with families and friends,

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:14.667
to throw some food on the
grill, and have a good time.

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:17.667
But it's also a day to
honor the American worker --

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:21.233
to reaffirm our commitment to
the great American middle class

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:26.367
that has, for generations, made
our economy the envy of the world.

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:28.700
That's especially important now.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.900
I don't have to tell you that
this is a very tough time for

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.500
our country.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.900
Millions of our neighbors have
been swept up in the worst

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.433
recession in our lifetimes.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.667
And long before
this recession hit,

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:43.066
the middle class had been
taking some hard shots.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.767
Long before this recession,
the values of hard work and

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:50.667
responsibility that built this
country had been given short shrift.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.667
For a decade, middle class
families felt the sting of

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:57.433
stagnant incomes and
declining economic security.

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:01.567
Companies were rewarded with
tax breaks for creating jobs overseas.

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:04.800
Wall Street firms turned
huge profits by taking,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.467
in some cases, reckless
risks and cutting corners.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:11.467
All of this came at the
expense of working Americans,

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:14.834
who were fighting harder and
harder just to stay afloat --

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:18.800
often borrowing against inflated
home values to pay their bills.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.467
Ultimately, that house
of cards collapsed.

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:25.400
So this Labor Day, we should
recommit ourselves to our

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.333
time-honored values and to this
fundamental truth: to heal our

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.767
economy, we need more than
a healthy stock market;

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:34.767
we need bustling main
streets and a growing,

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:36.900
thriving middle class.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.900
That's why I'll keep working day-by-day to restore

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.066
opportunity, economic security,
and that basic American Dream

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:47.300
for our families and
future generations.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.100
First, that means doing
everything we can to accelerate

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.900
job creation.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.367
The steps we've taken to date
have stopped the bleeding:

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:58.500
investments in roads and bridges
and high-speed railroads that

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.900
will lead to hundreds of
thousands of jobs in the private

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.333
sector; emergency steps to
prevent the layoffs of hundreds

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.700
of thousands of teachers
and firefighters and police

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.400
officers; and tax cuts and loans
for small business owners who

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.100
create most of the
jobs in this country.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.800
We also ended a tax loophole
that encouraged companies to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.967
create jobs overseas.

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:22.633
Instead, I'm fighting to pass a
law to provide tax breaks to the

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:25.967
folks who create jobs
right here in America.

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:28.633
But strengthening our economy
means more than that.

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:30.533
We're fighting to build an
economy in which middle class

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:32.934
families can afford to send
their kids to college,

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:36.767
buy a home, save for retirement,
and achieve some measure of

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:40.367
economic security when their
working days are done.

00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:42.433
And over the last two years,
that has meant taking on some

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:45.233
powerful interests who had
been dominating the agenda in

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:48.133
Washington for far too long.

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:50.900
That's why we've put an end to
the wasteful subsidies to big

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.000
banks that provide
student loans.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.867
We're going to use that money instead to make college more

00:02:55.867 --> 00:02:57.967
affordable for students.

00:02:57.967 --> 00:03:00.100
That's why we're making it
easier for workers to save for

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.900
retirement, with new ways of
saving their tax refunds and a

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.300
simpler system for enrolling in retirement plans like 401(k)s.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.400
And we're going to keep up the
fight to protect Social Security

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.934
for generations to come.

00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:16.200
That's why we stopped insurance
companies from refusing to cover

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.934
people with pre-existing
conditions and dropping folks

00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:21.467
who become seriously ill.

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:25.300
And that's why we cut taxes
for 95% of working families,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.633
and passed a law to help make
sure women earn equal pay for

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:31.500
equal work in the United
States of America.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.567
This Labor Day, we are reminded
that we didn't become the most

00:03:34.567 --> 00:03:39.400
prosperous country in the
world by rewarding greed and recklessness.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.934
We did it by rewarding hard
work and responsibility.

00:03:42.934 --> 00:03:46.266
We did it by recognizing that we
rise or we fall together as one

00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:51.200
nation -- one people -- all of us vested in one another.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.500
That's how we've
succeeded in the past.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.333
And that is how we will not
only rebuild this economy,

00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:59.233
but rebuild it stronger
than ever before.

00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:00.533
Thank you.

00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:02.734
And I hope you have a
great Labor Day weekend.
