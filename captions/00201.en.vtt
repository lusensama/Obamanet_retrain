00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.266
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.934
In the State of the Union, I
laid out three areas we need to

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:13.467
focus on if we're going to
build an economy that lasts:

00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:16.800
new American manufacturing,
new skills and education for

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.033
American workers, and new
sources of American-made energy.

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:24.233
These days, we're getting
another painful reminder why

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.700
developing new energy is
so important to our future.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.066
Just like they did last
year, gas prices are

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.633
starting to climb.

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:33.300
Only this time, it's
happening earlier.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.633
And that hurts everyone --
everybody who owns a car;

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:38.667
everybody who owns a business.

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:41.834
It means you have to stretch
your paycheck even further.

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:44.133
Some folks have no choice but
to drive a long way to work,

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:47.200
and high gas prices are
like a tax straight out of

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.166
their paychecks.

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:53.633
Now, some politicians always see
this as a political opportunity.

00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:56.233
And since it's an election year,
they're already dusting off

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:59.867
their same three-point
plan for $2 gas.

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:03.000
I'll save you the suspense:
Step one -- according to them --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.233
is drill, step two is drill, and
step three is to keep drilling.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:10.667
We hear the same
thing every year.

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.333
We've heard the same
thing for 30 years.

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:16.667
Well, the American
people aren't stupid.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.333
You know that's not a plan
-- especially since we're

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.000
already drilling.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.467
It's a bumper sticker.

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:25.467
It's not a strategy to
solve our energy challenge.

00:01:25.467 --> 00:01:28.867
It's a strategy to get
politicians through an election.

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:31.166
You know there are no quick
fixes to this problem,

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:35.000
and you know we can't just drill
our way to lower gas prices.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.900
If we're going to take control
of our energy future and avoid

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.066
these gas price spikes down the
line, then we need a sustained,

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:45.333
all-of-the-above strategy that
develops every available source

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:50.800
of American energy -- oil,
gas, wind, solar, nuclear,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.100
biofuels, and more.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.967
We need to keep developing the
technology that allows us to use

00:01:55.967 --> 00:02:00.934
less oil in our cars and trucks;
in our buildings and plants.

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:03.066
That's the strategy
we're pursuing,

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:06.533
and that's the only real
solution to this challenge.

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:10.200
Now, we absolutely need safe,
responsible oil production here

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.567
in America.

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:13.133
And that's why under
my Administration,

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:16.667
America is producing more oil
today than at any time in the

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:18.400
last eight years.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.066
In 2010, our dependence on
foreign oil was under 50% for

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:25.667
the first time in
more than a decade.

00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:27.700
And while there are no
short-term silver bullets when

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.867
it comes to gas prices, I've
directed my administration to

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:34.600
look for every single area where
we can make an impact and help

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.333
consumers in the months ahead,
from permitting to delivery

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:42.300
bottlenecks to what's going
on in the oil markets.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.467
But over the long term, an
all-of-the-above energy strategy

00:02:45.467 --> 00:02:47.433
means we have to do more.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.867
It means we have to
make some choices.

00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:51.100
Here's one example.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.400
Right now, four billion of your
tax dollars subsidize the oil

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.567
industry every year.

00:02:57.567 --> 00:02:59.233
Four billion dollars.

00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:00.834
Imagine that.

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:03.800
Maybe some of you are listening
to this in your car right now,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.467
pulling into a gas
station to fill up.

00:03:06.467 --> 00:03:10.066
As you watch those numbers rise,
know that oil company profits

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:11.333
have never been higher.

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:14.800
Yet somehow, Congress is still
giving those same companies

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.233
another four billion
dollars of your money.

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:19.333
It's outrageous.

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:21.333
And it has to stop.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:24.734
A century of subsidies to the
oil companies is long enough.

00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:27.700
It's time to end taxpayer
giveaways to an industry that's

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.767
never been more profitable, and
use that money to reduce our

00:03:30.767 --> 00:03:34.500
deficit and double-down on a
clean energy industry that's

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.734
never been more promising.

00:03:36.734 --> 00:03:39.033
Because of the investments
we've already made,

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:41.734
the use of wind and solar energy
in this country has nearly

00:03:41.734 --> 00:03:44.400
doubled -- and thousands
of Americans have jobs

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400
because of it.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.333
And because we put in place the
toughest fuel economy standards

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:52.100
in history, our cars will
average nearly 55 miles per

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.333
gallon by the middle
of the next decade --

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:57.200
something that, over time, will
save the typical family more

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.300
than $8,000 at the pump.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.367
Now Congress needs to keep that
momentum going by renewing the

00:04:03.367 --> 00:04:07.033
clean energy tax credits that
will lead to more jobs and less

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:10.000
dependence on foreign oil.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.700
Look, we know there's no silver
bullet that will bring down gas

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.066
prices or reduce our dependence
on foreign oil overnight.

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:21.200
But what we can do is get
our priorities straight,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.533
and make a sustained, serious
effort to tackle this problem.

00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:27.567
That's the commitment
we need right now.

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:31.100
And with your help, it's
a commitment we can make.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.100
Thanks.
