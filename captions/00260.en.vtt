00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:08.066
The President:
Right now, there's a big debate taking place in Washington

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:11.400
that'll affect how much
you pay in taxes next year.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.600
If Congress doesn't act, tax
rates will automatically go up

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.433
for just about everybody
in our country.

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:22.333
Typical middle class families
would end up paying an extra $3,000.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.266
That's unacceptable to me.

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:27.033
Not when we know that it's the
middle class that was hit the

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.900
hardest by the recession.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.133
And not when we know that taking
this money out of the pockets of

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:35.567
working people is exactly the
wrong thing to do to get our

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:37.867
economy growing faster.

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:41.033
Economists tell us that this tax
hike on working families would

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:44.834
actually cost us well
over a million jobs.

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:49.233
That's why I've been fighting so
hard to cut middle class taxes.

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:52.200
And that's why I brought both
Democrats and Republicans to the

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.867
table -- to put
together a compromise,

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:56.333
and work through
our differences,

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.233
so we could get this done.

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:01.734
Now, Republicans in Congress
strongly favored permanent tax

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:04.900
breaks for the wealthiest
taxpayers and the wealthiest

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.033
estates, most of which would
go to millionaires and even billionaires.

00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:13.300
I didn't believe that these
tax cuts were worth the cost.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.300
They'd add to our deficits
without really boosting the economy.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.367
I believed instead that the
best way to help the economy,

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:24.200
and working families, was to
keep middle class tax rates low,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.433
and cut taxes for working
parents, college students,

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:29.266
and small businesses.

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.300
And I believed that with
millions of people looking for

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.800
jobs, it would be a terrible
mistake to end unemployment

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.967
insurance -- not only for
people who are out of work,

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:40.400
but for our entire economy.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.033
So we hammered out a deal that
reflects ideas from both sides.

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:47.266
It wasn't easy, and it's
by no means perfect.

00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:49.667
And as with any compromise,
everybody had to live with

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:51.767
elements they didn't like.

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:54.367
But this is a good deal
for the American people.

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:57.133
The vast majority of the tax
cuts in this plan will help the

00:01:57.133 --> 00:02:01.934
middle class, including a new
cut in payroll taxes that will

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:05.066
save the average
family about $1,000.

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:07.266
And as this plan is
debated in Congress,

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:10.066
what I want to make clear is the
real difference it will make in

00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:11.800
people's lives.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.333
It's going to make a difference
for a single mom with two kids

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.633
in Ohio working as a cashier.

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:20.166
With this plan, she'd get a new
payroll tax cut and a bigger

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:24.967
child tax credit together
worth more than $2,300.

00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:26.834
It's going to make a difference
for a couple in Florida earning

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:32.033
about $50,000 and trying to put
one of their two kids through college.

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:35.433
They'd save more than $4,000
because the middle class tax

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:41.533
cuts -- including a $2,500 tax credit to go towards college tuition.

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:43.500
And it's going to make an
enormous difference for people

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.867
looking for work.

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:48.533
For many of these families,
emergency unemployment insurance

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:53.066
is the last line of defense
between hardship and catastrophe.

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:56.433
And I'd point out, if these
folks stop spending money,

00:02:56.433 --> 00:02:59.533
it will also hurt businesses,
which will hurt hiring,

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:01.900
which will damage our economy.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.033
So this plan is going to help
millions of families to make

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:07.600
ends meet because of tax cuts
and unemployment insurance for

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.667
people who've lost their jobs
by no fault of their own.

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:13.500
And we included tax relief
for businesses, too --

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.533
making it easier for them
to invest and expand.

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:21.000
All told, this will not only
directly help families and businesses.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.066
By putting more money
in people's pockets,

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:25.834
and helping companies grow,
we're going to see people being

00:03:25.834 --> 00:03:29.367
able to spend a little more,
we're going to spur hiring --

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:32.333
we're going to strengthen
our entire economy.

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:35.000
Now, I recognize that many of
my friends in my own party are

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.700
uncomfortable with some of
what's in this agreement,

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.900
in particular the temporary
tax cuts for the wealthy.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.000
I share their concerns.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.266
I don't like those
tax cuts either.

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:46.767
It's clear that
over the long run,

00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:48.867
if we're serious about
balancing the budget,

00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:52.767
we can't continue to afford
these tax breaks for the

00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:55.266
wealthiest taxpayers -- especially when we know that

00:03:55.266 --> 00:03:59.000
cutting the deficit is going to demand sacrifice from everyone.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.333
That's the reality.

00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:04.200
But at the same time, we can't
allow the middle class in this

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.700
country to be caught in
the political crossfire of Washington.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.533
People want us to find
solutions, not score points.

00:04:11.533 --> 00:04:13.900
And I will not allow middle
class families to be treated

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.066
like pawns on a chessboard.

00:04:17.066 --> 00:04:19.867
The opportunity for families
to send their kids to college

00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:22.066
hinges on this debate.

00:04:22.066 --> 00:04:24.667
The ability of parents to put
food on the table while looking

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:27.500
for a job depends
on this debate.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.033
And our recovery will be
strengthened or weakened based

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:33.734
on the choice that now
rests with Congress.

00:04:33.734 --> 00:04:38.100
So I strongly urge members of
both parties to pass this plan.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.834
And I'm confident that they
will do the right thing,

00:04:40.834 --> 00:04:44.900
strengthening the middle class
and our economic recovery.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.900
Thanks.
