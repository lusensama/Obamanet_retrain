00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:10.744
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:14.514
Thirty years ago, there
were 500,000 people

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.983
behind bars in America.

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:19.886
Today, there are
2.2 million.

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:23.556
The United States is home to
5 percent of the world's

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:28.628
population, but 25 percent
of the world's prisoners.

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:32.332
Every year, we spend $80
billion to keep people

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.300
locked up.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.203
Now, many of the folks in
prison absolutely belong

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.739
there - our streets are
safer thanks to the brave

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.342
police officers and
dedicated prosecutors who

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:45.412
put violent criminals
behind bars.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:47.414
But over the last few
decades, we've also locked

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:50.283
up more non-violent
offenders than ever before,

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:51.751
for longer than ever before.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:55.855
That's the real reason our
prison population is so high.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.059
Ever since I was a Senator,
I've talked about how, in

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.929
too many cases, our criminal
justice system is a pipeline

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.266
from underfunded schools to
overcrowded jails.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.368
And we've taken steps to
address it.

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:11.604
We invested in our schools
to give at-risk young people

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:13.573
a better shot to succeed.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:16.609
I signed a bill reducing the
100 to 1 sentencing

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.612
disparity between crack and
powder cocaine.

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:21.781
I've commuted the sentences
of dozens of people

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:25.418
sentenced under old drug laws we
now recognize were unfair.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:29.055
The Department of Justice
has gotten "Smart on Crime,"

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:31.991
refocusing efforts on the
worst offenders, and

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:36.396
pursuing mandatory minimum
sentences less frequently.

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:39.666
Still, much of our criminal
justice system remains

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.134
unfair.

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:43.636
In recent years, more of our
eyes have been opened to

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:44.704
this truth.

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:45.738
We can't close them anymore.

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:49.409
And good people, of all
political persuasions, are

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.711
eager to do something about
it.

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:53.813
Over the next few weeks,
I'll travel the country to

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:55.815
highlight some of the
Americans who are doing

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:58.284
their part to fix our
criminal justice system.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.286
I'll visit a community
battling prescription drug

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.754
and heroin abuse.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.723
I'll speak with leaders from
law enforcement who are

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:06.025
determined to lower the
crime rate and the

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.862
incarceration rate, and with
police chiefs who have

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:11.664
dedicated their careers to
keeping our streets and

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.366
officers safe.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.535
I'll meet with former
prisoners who are earning

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.437
their second chance.

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:19.973
And I'll keep working with
lawmakers from both parties

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.475
who are determined to get
criminal justice reform

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.611
bills to my desk.

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:27.013
Earlier this month,
Democrats and Republicans

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:29.616
came together in the Senate
to introduce such a bill -

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.618
one that would reduce
mandatory minimums for

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.787
non-violent drug offenders,
and reward prisoners with

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:38.124
shorter sentences if they
complete programs that make

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:41.194
them less likely to commit a
repeat offense.

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:43.196
There's a similar bill
working its way through the

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:45.832
House, and I'm encouraged by
these kinds of bipartisan

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:46.833
efforts.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.435
This is progress - not
liberal ideas or

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.871
conservative ideas, but
common-sense solutions to

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.140
the challenges we face.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.943
From the halls of Congress to
the classrooms in our

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:59.579
schools, we pledge
allegiance to one nation

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.949
under God with liberty, and
justice, for all.

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.485
Justice means that every
child deserves a chance to

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.620
grow up safe and secure,
without the threat of

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.088
violence.

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:11.724
Justice means that the
punishment should fit the

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.059
crime.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.161
And justice means allowing
our fellow Americans who

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.665
have made mistakes to pay
their debt to society, and

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:21.467
re-join their community as
active, rehabilitated

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:23.536
citizens.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:26.773
Justice has never been easy
to achieve, but it's always

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:27.840
been worth fighting for.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.577
And it's something I'll keep
fighting for as long as I

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:33.446
serve as your president.

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:35.448
Thanks, and have a great
weekend.
