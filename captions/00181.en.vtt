00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:11.394
The President:
This week, the Senate passed a
plan that I proposed a few weeks

00:00:11.394 --> 00:00:14.394
ago to protect middle class
Americans and virtually every

00:00:14.394 --> 00:00:17.961
small business owner from
getting hit with a big tax hike

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:23.695
next year -- a tax hike of
$2,200 for the typical family.

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:28.328
Now it comes down to this: If
218 Members of the House vote

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:33.361
the right way, 98% of American
families and 97% of small

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:36.161
business owners will have the
certainty of knowing that their

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.961
income taxes will
not go up next year.

00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:41.628
That certainty means something
to a middle class family who's

00:00:41.628 --> 00:00:44.594
already stretched the
budget as far as it can go.

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:46.895
It means something to a small
business owner who's trying to

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:48.528
plan ahead.

00:00:48.528 --> 00:00:52.094
That's security at a time when
folks could use some security.

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:54.895
And here's the thing: everyone
in Washington says they

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:56.261
agree on this.

00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:59.094
Everyone says they agree that we
should extend the tax cuts for

00:00:59.094 --> 00:01:00.528
the middle class.

00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:03.528
When Democrats and Republicans
agree on something,

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:06.161
it should be pretty
easy to get it done.

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:08.328
But right now,
that's not the case.

00:01:08.328 --> 00:01:10.828
Instead of doing what's right
for middle class families and

00:01:10.828 --> 00:01:13.628
small business owners,
Republicans in Congress are

00:01:13.628 --> 00:01:17.561
holding these tax cuts hostage
until we extend tax cuts for the

00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:19.594
wealthiest Americans.

00:01:19.594 --> 00:01:22.761
You see, Republicans in Congress
and their nominee for President

00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:25.361
believe that the best way to
create prosperity in America is

00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:27.594
to let it trickle
down from the top.

00:01:27.594 --> 00:01:30.561
They believe that if our country
spends trillions more on tax

00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:33.594
cuts for the wealthy, we'll
somehow create jobs --

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:36.628
even if we have to pay for it
by gutting things like education

00:01:36.628 --> 00:01:40.994
and training and by
raising middle-class taxes.

00:01:40.994 --> 00:01:42.161
They're wrong.

00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:44.661
And I know they're wrong because
we already tried it that way for

00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:46.661
most of the last decade.

00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:48.094
It didn't work.

00:01:48.094 --> 00:01:51.194
We're still paying for trillions
of dollars in tax cuts that

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:54.194
benefited the wealthiest
Americans more than anyone else;

00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:57.094
tax cuts that didn't lead to
the middle class jobs or higher

00:01:57.094 --> 00:02:00.194
wages we were promised and
that helped take us from record

00:02:00.194 --> 00:02:02.895
surpluses to record deficits.

00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:05.594
We can't afford more
top-down economics.

00:02:05.594 --> 00:02:08.094
What we need are policies that
will grow and strengthen the

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:10.728
middle class; that
will help create jobs,

00:02:10.728 --> 00:02:12.861
make education and
training more affordable,

00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:15.961
and encourage businesses to
start up and stay right here in

00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:17.861
the United States.

00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:20.261
That's why I've cut middle-class
taxes every year that I've been

00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:24.928
President -- by $3,600
for the typical family.

00:02:24.928 --> 00:02:28.528
That's why I've cut taxes for
small businesses 18 times.

00:02:28.528 --> 00:02:32.528
And that's why I'm calling on
218 Members of the House to do

00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:36.695
their jobs and not raise
taxes on the middle class.

00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:39.728
As soon as they pass that
bill, I'll sign it right away.

00:02:39.728 --> 00:02:42.161
And in the meantime, I'm going
to keep fighting for an economy

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.728
where we're not just
putting folks back to work,

00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:47.461
but making sure that
work pays off --

00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:50.394
an economy where every
American, no matter who you are,

00:02:50.394 --> 00:02:53.094
what you look like, or
where you come from,

00:02:53.094 --> 00:02:55.961
can have the confidence
that if you work hard,

00:02:55.961 --> 00:02:57.628
you can get ahead.

00:02:57.628 --> 00:02:59.761
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
