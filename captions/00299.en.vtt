00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.066
Over the past few days, I've
been traveling through the

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.133
Middle East and Europe working
to renew our alliances,

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:15.266
enhance our common security,
and propose a new partnership

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.567
between the United States
and the Muslim world.

00:00:18.567 --> 00:00:21.333
But even as I'm abroad, I'm
firmly focused on the other

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.900
pressing challenges we face --
including the urgent need to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.500
reform our health care system.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.300
Even as we speak, Congress is
preparing to introduce and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.967
debate health reform legislation
that is the product of many

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.700
months of effort
and deliberation.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.166
And if you're like any of the
Americans I've met across this

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.767
country who know all too well
that the soaring costs of health

00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:45.900
care make our current
course unsustainable,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.266
I imagine you'll be watching
their progress closely.

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.700
I'm talking about the families
I've met whose spiraling

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.967
premiums and out-of-pocket
expenses are pushing them into

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:58.433
bankruptcy or forcing them to
go without the check-ups or

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.367
prescriptions they need.

00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:03.800
Business owners who fear they'll
be forced to choose between

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.000
keeping their doors open
or covering their workers.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.767
Americans who rightly worry that
the ballooning costs of Medicare

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:15.367
and Medicaid could lead to
fiscal catastrophe down the road.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:18.533
Simply put, the
status quo is broken.

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.633
We cannot continue this way.

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:24.700
If we do nothing, everyone's
health care will be put in jeopardy.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.266
Within a decade, we'll spend one
dollar out of every five we earn

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:31.967
on health care -- and we'll keep
getting less for our money.

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:33.967
And that's why fixing what's wrong with our health care

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:37.066
system is no longer a
luxury we hope to achieve --

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:41.233
it's a necessity we
cannot postpone any longer.

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:43.433
The growing consensus around
that reality has led an

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:46.867
unprecedented coalition to
come together for change.

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:48.900
Unlike past attempts at
reforming our health care

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.400
system, everyone
is at the table --

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.166
patients advocates and health insurers; business and labor;

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:58.200
Democrats and Republicans alike.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.133
A few weeks ago, some of these
improbable allies committed to

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:04.633
cut national health care
spending by two trillion dollars

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:06.300
over the next decade.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.533
What makes this so remarkable is
that it probably wouldn't have

00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:12.400
happened just a few
short years ago.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.767
But today, at this
historic juncture,

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:18.867
even old adversaries are united
around the same goal: quality,

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:21.734
affordable health care
for all Americans.

00:02:21.734 --> 00:02:24.367
Now, I know that when you bring
together disparate groups with

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:27.266
differing views, there
will be lively debate.

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:29.066
And that's a debate I welcome.

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:32.767
But what we can't accept is
reform that just invests more

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:36.300
money in the status quo -- reform that throws good money

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.200
after bad habits.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.166
Instead, we must attack the root causes of skyrocketing health care costs.

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:45.233
Now, some of these costs are
the result of unwarranted

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:48.734
profiteering that has no place in our health care system,

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:51.600
and in too many communities,
folks are paying higher costs

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.834
without receiving
better care in return.

00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:57.500
And yet we know, for example,
that there are places like the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.166
Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, the
Cleveland Clinic in Ohio,

00:03:01.166 --> 00:03:03.900
and other institutions that
offer some of the highest

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.567
quality of care in the nation at
some of the lowest costs in the nation.

00:03:08.567 --> 00:03:11.266
We should learn from their
successes and promote the best

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:14.266
practices, not the
most expensive ones.

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:17.734
That's how we'll achieve reform
that fixes what doesn't work,

00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:19.800
and builds on what does.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.400
This week, I conveyed to
Congress my belief that any

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.967
health care reform must be built
around fundamental reforms that

00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:29.133
lower costs, improve
quality and coverage,

00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:31.600
and also protect
consumer choice.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.967
And that means if you like the plan you have, you can keep it.

00:03:34.967 --> 00:03:38.500
If you like the doctor you have,
you can keep your doctor, too.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.500
The only change you'll see are
falling costs as our reforms take hold.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.533
I've also made it very clear to
Congress that we must develop a

00:03:46.533 --> 00:03:49.867
plan that doesn't add
to our budget deficit.

00:03:49.867 --> 00:03:53.467
My budget included a historic
down payment on reform,

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:56.800
and we'll work with Congress to
fully cover the costs through

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.900
rigorous spending reductions and
appropriate additional revenues.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.333
We'll eliminate waste, fraud,
and abuse in our health care

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:07.567
system, but we'll also take on
key causes of rising costs --

00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:11.967
saving billions while providing
better care to the American people.

00:04:11.967 --> 00:04:15.166
Now, all across America, our families are making hard choices

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:17.033
when it comes to health care.

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:20.000
Now, it's time for Washington
to make the right ones.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.700
It's time to deliver.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.734
And I'm absolutely convinced
that if we keep working together

00:04:24.734 --> 00:04:27.367
and living up to our
mutual responsibilities;

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:30.467
if we place the American
people's interests above the

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:34.200
special interests; we will seize
this historic opportunity to

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.367
finally fix what ails our
broken health care system,

00:04:37.367 --> 00:04:42.300
and strengthen our economy and
our country now and for decades to come.
