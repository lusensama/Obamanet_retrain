00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.433
The President:
I'm speaking to you from
Caminada Bay in Grand Isle,

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:12.000
Louisiana, one of the first
places to feel the devastation

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.100
wrought by the oil spill
in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.867
While I was here, at
Camerdelle's Live Bait shop,

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:21.100
I met with a group of local
residents and small business owners.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.000
Folks like Floyd Lasseigne,
a fourth-generation oyster fisherman.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.633
This is the time of year when he
ordinarily earns a lot of his income.

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:31.934
But his oyster bed, along the
north side of Grand Isle,

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:34.533
has likely been
destroyed by the spill.

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.367
Terry Vegas has a similar story.

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:40.633
He quit the 8th grade to become
a shrimper with his grandfather.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:43.266
Ever since, he's earned his
living during shrimping season

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:46.200
-- working long, grueling days so that he could earn enough

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.867
money to support
himself year round.

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:53.133
But today, the waters where he's
spent his years are closed.

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.000
And every day, as
the spill worsens,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.133
he loses hope that he'll be able
to return to the life he built.

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.867
"You can put a price on a
lost season," he's said.

00:01:01.867 --> 00:01:04.266
"But not a lost heritage."

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:07.567
The effects of the spill
reach beyond the shoreline.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:10.066
I spoke with Patti Rigaud.

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.867
For 30 years, she's owned a
small convenience store --

00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:14.900
a store opened by her father.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.033
She depends on the sales
generated by tourism each summer.

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:21.800
But this year, most of the boats
that would line these docks are

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.600
nowhere to be seen.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.066
Dudley Gaspard, who owns the
Sand Dollar Marina and Hotel,

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.967
has been hit hard as well.

00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:31.967
Normally, this time of year,
rooms are filling up and tackle

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:33.834
is flying off the shelves.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:36.433
But he too has been devastated
by the decline in tourism and

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:41.000
the suspension of fishing in the
waters off the Louisiana Coast.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Their stories are familiar
to many in Grand Isle and

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.133
throughout the Gulf region.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.567
Often families have been
here for generations,

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.600
earning a living,
and making a life,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.066
that's tied to the water -- that's tied to the magnificent

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:56.667
coasts and the natural
bounty of this place.

00:01:56.667 --> 00:02:00.333
Here, this spill has not
just damaged livelihoods.

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:02.734
It's upended whole communities.

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:06.767
And the fury people feel is not
just about the money they've lost.

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:09.133
They've been through
tough times before.

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:12.700
It's about the wrenching
recognition that this time their

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.233
lives may never be the same.

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:16.900
These folks work hard.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.066
They meet their
responsibilities.

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:22.166
But now because of a
manmade catastrophe --

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.867
one that's not their fault
and beyond their control --

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:27.600
their lives have been
thrown into turmoil.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.567
It's brutally unfair.

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:30.867
It's wrong.

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:32.500
And what I told these
men and women --

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.400
and what I have said since the
beginning of this disaster --

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.600
is that I'm going to stand with
the people of the Gulf Coast

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.900
until they are made whole.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.767
That's why from the beginning,
we mobilized on every front to

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:44.934
contain and clean up this spill.

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:49.033
I've authorized the deployment of 17,000 National Guard troops

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:51.000
to aid in the response.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.767
More than 20,000 people are
currently working around the

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:56.667
clock to protect
waters and coastlines.

00:02:56.667 --> 00:02:59.734
We've convened hundreds of top
scientists and engineers from

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:01.600
around the world.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.633
More than 1,900 vessels are in
the Gulf assisting in the clean up.

00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:10.000
And more than 4.3 million feet of boom have been deployed with

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.133
another 2.9 million feet
of boom available --

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:16.467
enough to stretch
over 1,300 miles.

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:20.667
17 staging areas are in place across Louisiana, Mississippi,

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:25.233
Alabama, and Florida to rapidly defend sensitive shorelines.

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:28.367
In short, this is the largest
response to an environmental

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:32.734
disaster of its kind in
the history of the country.

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:35.533
We've also ordered BP to
pay economic injury claims,

00:03:35.533 --> 00:03:38.734
and we will make sure they pay
every single dime owed to the

00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:41.233
people along the Gulf Coast.

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:43.200
The Small Business
Administration has stepped in to

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.100
help businesses by approving
loans and allowing deferrals of

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.967
existing loan payments.

00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:52.367
And this week, the federal
government sent BP a preliminary

00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:57.467
bill for $69 million to pay back
American taxpayers for some of

00:03:57.467 --> 00:04:00.633
the costs of the
response so far.

00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:03.667
In addition, after an
emergency safety review,

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:05.800
we're putting in place
aggressive new operating

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.333
standards for offshore drilling.

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:11.100
And I've appointed a bipartisan
commission to look into the

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.266
causes of this spill.

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:16.667
If laws are inadequate
-- laws will be changed.

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:20.300
If oversight was lacking
-- it will be strengthened.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.266
And if laws were broken -- those responsible will be brought to justice.

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:28.800
Now, over the last few days BP
has placed a cap over the well,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.233
and it appears they're making some progress in trying to pump

00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:34.734
oil to the surface to keep it
from leaking into the water.

00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:37.033
But has -- has been the case since the beginning of this

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:39.567
crisis, we're
prepared for the worst,

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:42.300
even if we hope that BP's efforts bring better news

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.233
than we've received before.

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:47.734
We also know that regardless of
the outcome of this attempt,

00:04:47.734 --> 00:04:50.233
there will still to be some
slippage until the relief wells

00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:51.967
are completed.

00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:56.166
And there will continue to be
a massive cleanup ahead of us.

00:04:56.166 --> 00:04:58.133
These are hard times in
Louisiana and across the Gulf

00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:02.567
Coast, an area that's seen more than its fair share of trouble.

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:04.900
But what I've seen are communities absolutely

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.700
determined to fight through this
disaster as they have before,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.934
to preserve not just a way to
make a living but a way of life.

00:05:12.934 --> 00:05:15.000
And we will fight
alongside them,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.467
until the awful damage that
has been done is reversed,

00:05:18.467 --> 00:05:22.233
people are back on their feet,
and the great natural bounty of

00:05:22.233 --> 00:05:24.834
the Gulf Coast is restored.

00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:26.000
Thank you.
