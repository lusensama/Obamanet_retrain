00:00:05.658 --> 00:00:09.491
The President:
This week, we learned that our
economy added another 140,000

00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:11.825
private sector jobs in November.

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:13.858
Despite some strong
headwinds this year,

00:00:13.858 --> 00:00:17.124
America's economy has now
created private sector jobs for

00:00:17.124 --> 00:00:21.191
the past 21 months in a row --
almost three million new jobs

00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:24.358
in all, more than half a
million of them in the past

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:26.158
four months alone.

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:29.258
We need to keep this growth
going and strengthen it.

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:32.158
That's why we've been fighting
to pass a series of jobs bills

00:00:32.158 --> 00:00:35.458
through Congress - bills that
independent economists say will

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:39.358
create more jobs and grow
the economy even faster.

00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:41.925
Because now is the time
to step on the gas,

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:43.658
not slam on the brakes.

00:00:43.658 --> 00:00:46.224
Unfortunately, too many
Republicans in Congress

00:00:46.224 --> 00:00:48.991
don't seem to share that
same sense of urgency.

00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:51.591
Over the last few months,
they've said "no" to most

00:00:51.591 --> 00:00:53.258
of these jobs bills.

00:00:53.258 --> 00:00:56.224
"No" to putting teachers and
firefighters back to work.

00:00:56.224 --> 00:00:59.391
"No" to putting construction
workers back on the job.

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:02.858
And this week, they actually
said "no" to cutting taxes for

00:01:02.858 --> 00:01:05.058
middle-class families.

00:01:05.058 --> 00:01:07.792
You see, last year, both
parties came together to

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:10.758
cut payroll taxes for the
typical middle-class family

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:12.991
by about $1,000.

00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:16.325
But that tax cut is set to
expire at the end of this month.

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:19.358
If that happens, that same
family will see its taxes

00:01:19.358 --> 00:01:21.991
go up by $1,000.

00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:23.892
We can't let that happen.

00:01:23.892 --> 00:01:26.825
In fact, I think we should cut
taxes on working families and

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:29.291
small business owners even more.

00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:31.758
And we're going to keep pushing
Congress to make this happen.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.958
They shouldn't go home
for the holidays until

00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.291
they get this done.

00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:38.358
And if you agree with me,
I could use your help.

00:01:38.358 --> 00:01:42.491
We've set up a simple tax cut
calculator on WhiteHouse.gov so

00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:46.058
that you can see exactly what
the stakes are for your family.

00:01:46.058 --> 00:01:47.491
Try it out.

00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:50.825
Then let your members of
Congress know where you stand.

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:53.892
Tell them not to vote to raise
taxes on working Americans

00:01:53.892 --> 00:01:55.391
during the holidays.

00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:57.991
Tell them to put
country before party.

00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:00.658
Put money back in the
pockets of working Americans.

00:02:00.658 --> 00:02:03.591
Pass these tax cuts.

00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:05.491
We're all in this together.

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:09.491
The more Americans succeed,
the more America succeeds.

00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:12.425
And if we remember that and
do what it takes to keep this

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:15.191
economy growing and
opportunity rising,

00:02:15.191 --> 00:02:17.058
then I'm confident that
we'll come out of this

00:02:17.058 --> 00:02:18.758
stronger than before.
