00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.611
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.680
One of the most important
positions in the President's

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.816
Cabinet - and to our
national security, our

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:19.886
law enforcement, and our
criminal justice system -

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:21.940
is the Attorney General.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.520
It's been more than
four months since

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.394
I nominated Loretta Lynch
to serve as the next

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.996
Attorney General of
the United States.

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:32.732
For 30 years, Loretta has
distinguished herself

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:37.003
as a tough, fair, and
independent attorney.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.500
As the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.506
District of New York,

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.975
she successfully prosecuted
the terrorists who

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:44.077
plotted to bomb the
Federal Reserve Bank

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.246
and the New York
City subway.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.681
She helped secure billions
in settlements for people

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.651
wronged by some of the
world's biggest banks.

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:55.355
She's been dogged in her
pursuit of public corruption.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.457
She's jailed some of New
York's most violent

00:00:57.457 --> 00:01:00.427
and notorious mobsters
and gang members.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.429
And through it all, she's
worked closely with

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.798
law enforcement and
local communities to get

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:06.566
the job done.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:10.203
In short, her
qualifications are superb.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:12.872
That's why, in the past, the
Senate easily confirmed

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:15.341
Loretta to lead one of
the most prominent

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:18.111
U.S. Attorney offices
in the country -

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.181
not once, but twice.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.184
Still - it has been more
than four months since

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:26.186
I nominated Loretta
Lynch to serve

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.054
as Attorney General.

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:30.056
And this time, Republican
leaders in Congress won't

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:33.726
even let her nomination
come up for a vote.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.995
In fact, by Monday, Loretta
will have been languishing

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:38.531
on the Senate floor for
longer than the seven

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.834
previous Attorneys
General combined.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.270
Let me say that again - she
will have been waiting for

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.507
a simple yes-or-no vote on
the Senate floor for longer

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:51.611
than the seven previous
Attorney Generals combined.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:54.147
No one can claim
she's unqualified.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.816
No one's saying she
can't do the job.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.620
Senators from both parties
say they support her.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.256
This is purely
about politics.

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:05.358
First, Republicans held up
her nomination because they

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:07.360
were upset about the
actions I took to make our

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.296
broken immigration system
smarter and fairer.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.699
Now they're denying her a vote
until they can figure out

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:16.669
how to pass a bill on a
completely unrelated issue.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.838
But they could bring her
up for a yes-or-no vote

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:21.474
at any time.

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.476
Republicans promised
that Congress would

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:26.012
function smoothly with
them in charge.

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:29.249
Here's a small chance
for them to prove it.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.718
Congress should stop playing
politics with law enforcement

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.353
and national security.

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:35.421
They should support good
people in both parties

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:38.024
who want to reform our
criminal justice system.

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:40.693
And that means they should
end the longest confirmation

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:44.163
process for an Attorney
General in three decades,

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:47.467
and give Loretta
Lynch a vote.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:48.434
Thanks.

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:49.435
And have a
great weekend.
