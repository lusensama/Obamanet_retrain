00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:07.166
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.633
In the coming weeks, we face
some important decisions about

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:12.767
how to pay down our debt in a
way that grows our economy and

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:16.266
creates good jobs -- decisions
that will make a real difference

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.233
in the strength and
pace of our recovery.

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:21.367
We began this year with
economists and business leaders

00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:25.166
saying that we are
poised to grow in 2013.

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.934
And there are real
signs of progress:

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:29.500
Home prices are starting
to climb again.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.200
Car sales are at
a five-year high.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.767
Manufacturing is roaring back.

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:38.400
Our businesses created 2.2
million jobs last year.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.033
And we just learned that our
economy created more jobs over

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:45.066
the last few months than
economists originally thought.

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.967
But this week, we also received
the first estimate of America's

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:50.166
economic growth over
the last few months.

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.967
And it reminded us that bad
decisions in Washington can get

00:00:53.967 --> 00:00:56.433
in the way of our
economic progress.

00:00:56.433 --> 00:01:00.133
We all agree that it's critical
to cut unnecessary spending.

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:03.166
But we can't just cut
our way to prosperity.

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.533
It hasn't worked in the past,
and it won't work today.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.900
It could slow down our recovery.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.834
It could weaken our economy.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:13.967
And it could cost us
jobs -- not just now,

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:16.066
but in the future.

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.834
What we need instead
is a balanced approach;

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:22.033
an approach that says let's cut
what we can't afford but let's

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:25.667
make the investments we
can't afford to live without.

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:28.400
Investments in education
and infrastructure,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.200
research and development -- the
things that will help America

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.066
compete for the best
jobs and new industries.

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.400
Already, Republicans and
Democrats have worked together

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.433
to reduce our deficits
by $2.5 trillion.

00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:44.533
That's a good start.

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:47.600
But to get the rest of the
way, we need a balanced set

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.000
of reforms.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.967
For example, we need to lower
the cost of health care in

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:54.734
programs like Medicare that
are the biggest drivers of our

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:58.567
deficit, without just passing
the burden off to seniors.

00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:01.533
And these reforms must go
hand-in-hand with eliminating

00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:04.767
excess spending in our tax
code, so that the wealthiest

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:07.300
individuals and biggest
corporations can't take

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.300
advantage of loopholes and
deductions that aren't available

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.266
to most Americans.

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:16.333
2013 can be a year of
solid growth, more jobs,

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:17.867
and higher wages.

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:21.066
But that will only happen if
we put a stop to self-inflicted

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:23.133
wounds in Washington.

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:26.266
Everyone in Washington needs
to focus not on politics but on

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:29.667
what's right for the country;
on what's right for you and

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:31.133
your families.

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:33.567
That's how we'll get our
economy growing faster.

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:35.934
That's how we'll strengthen
our middle class.

00:02:35.934 --> 00:02:38.900
And that's how we'll build a
country that rewards the effort

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.233
and determination of
every single American.

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:43.233
Thanks.

00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:44.233
And have a great weekend.
