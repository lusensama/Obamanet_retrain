00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.333
The President:
Tuesday is Election Day, and here in Washington,

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.367
the talk is all about who will
win and who will lose --

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:13.700
about parties and politics.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.500
But around kitchen tables, I'm
pretty sure you're talking about

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.433
other things: about your family
finances,

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:22.266
or maybe the state of the
economy in your hometown;

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.333
about your kids, and what their
futures will bring.

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.000
And your hope is that once this
election is over,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.867
the folks you choose to represent you will put politics

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:34.867
aside for a while, and work together to solve problems.

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.934
That's my hope, too.

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:40.834
Whatever the outcome on Tuesday,
we need to come together to help

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:44.367
put people who are still looking
for jobs back to work.

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:47.200
And there are some practical
steps we can take right away to

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.333
promote growth and encourage
businesses to hire and expand.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.033
These are steps we all should be
able to agree on --

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.300
not Democratic or Republican
ideas,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.867
but proposals that have
traditionally been supported by

00:00:58.867 --> 00:01:00.400
both parties.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.800
We ought to provide continued
tax relief for middle class

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.633
families who have borne the
brunt of the recession.

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:08.500
We ought to allow businesses to
defer taxes on the equipment

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.333
they buy next year.

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.900
And we ought to make the
research and experimentation tax

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.667
credit bigger and permanent -- to spur innovation and foster

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.166
new products and technologies.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.200
Beyond these near-term steps, we
should work together to tackle

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.433
the broader challenges facing
our country --

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:28.734
so that we remain competitive
and prosperous in a global economy.

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:30.734
That means ensuring that our
young people have the skills and

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:33.800
education to fill the jobs of a
new age.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.700
That means building new
infrastructure --

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.033
from high-speed trains to
high-speed internet --

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:40.533
so that our economy has room to
grow.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.200
And that means fostering a
climate of innovation and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.667
entrepreneurship that will allow
American businesses and American

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:51.500
workers to lead in growth
industries like clean energy.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.467
On these issues -- issues that will determine our success or

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:58.000
failure in this new century -- I believe it's the fundamental

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.033
responsibility of all who hold elective office to seek out

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:03.767
common ground.

00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:06.166
It may not be always easy to
find agreement;

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:09.467
at times we'll have legitimate
philosophical differences.

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:11.834
And it may not always be the
best politics.

00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:14.500
But it's the right thing to do
for our country.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.133
That's why I found the recent
comments by the top two

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:20.100
Republicans in Congress so
troubling.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.467
The Republican leader of the
House actually said that "this

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:24.800
is not the time for compromise."

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.133
And the Republican leader of the
Senate said his main goal after

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:31.000
this election is simply to win
the next one.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.266
I know that we're in the final
days of a campaign.

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:36.400
So it's not surprising that
we're seeing this heated rhetoric.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.734
That's politics.

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:40.266
But when the ballots are cast
and the voting is done,

00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:43.066
we need to put this kind of
partisanship aside --

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:45.600
win, lose, or draw.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.300
In the end, it comes down to a
simple choice.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.033
We can spend the next two years
arguing with one another,

00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:53.800
trapped in stale debates, mired
in gridlock,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.700
unable to make progress in
solving the serious problems

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.500
facing our country.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.934
We can stand still while our
competitors --

00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:03.000
like China and others around the
world --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.934
try to pass us by, making the
critical decisions that will

00:03:05.934 --> 00:03:09.400
allow them to gain an edge in
new industries.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.200
Or we can do what the American
people are demanding that we do.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.567
We can move forward.

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:17.200
We can promote new jobs and
businesses by harnessing the

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.100
talents and ingenuity of our
people.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.600
We can take the necessary steps
to help the next generation --

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.600
instead of just worrying about
the next election.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.033
We can live up to an allegiance
far stronger than our membership

00:03:30.033 --> 00:03:31.934
in any political party.

00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:35.533
And that's the allegiance we
hold to our country.

00:03:35.533 --> 00:03:36.567
Thanks.
