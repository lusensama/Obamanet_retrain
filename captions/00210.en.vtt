The President:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.767
As 2011 comes to an end
and we look ahead to 2012,

00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:14.233
I want to wish everyone a
happy and healthy New Year.

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:16.967
The last year has been a time
of great challenge and great

00:00:16.967 --> 00:00:18.867
progress for our country.

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:21.934
We ended one war and began
to wind down another.

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:24.667
We dealt a crippling blow
to al Qaeda and made America

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.133
more secure.

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.433
We stood by our friends and
allies around the world through

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:31.000
natural disasters
and revolutions.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.867
And we began to see signs of
economic recovery here at home,

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:38.367
even as too many Americans are
still struggling to get ahead.

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:41.633
There's no doubt that 2012
will bring even more change.

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:43.133
And as we head
into the New Year,

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.400
I'm hopeful that we have what
it takes to face that change and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.400
come out even stronger
-- to grow our economy,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.867
create more jobs, and
strengthen the middle class.

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:56.066
I'm hopeful because of what
we saw right before Christmas,

00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:59.166
when Members of Congress came
together to prevent a tax hike

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:03.300
for 160 million Americans --
saving a typical family about

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.367
$40 in every paycheck.

00:01:05.367 --> 00:01:08.133
They also made sure Americans
looking for work won't see their

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.834
unemployment insurance cut off.

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:13.367
And I expect Congress to finish
the job by extending these

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:16.667
provisions through
the end of 2012.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:18.900
It was good to see members of
Congress do the right thing for

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.633
millions of working Americans.

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:24.000
But it was only possible because
you added your voices to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.066
the debate.

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.600
Through email and Twitter
and over the phone,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.633
you let your representatives
know what was at stake.

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:31.800
Your lives.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.133
Your families.

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.834
Your well-being.

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:37.400
You had the courage to believe
that your voices could make

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.500
a difference.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.767
And at the end of the day,
they made all the difference.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:44.333
So more than anything else, you
are the ones who make me hopeful

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.100
about 2012.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.433
Because we've got some
difficult debates and some tough

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:49.734
fights to come.

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:52.533
As I've said before, we are at
a make-or-break moment for the

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:53.567
middle class.

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:56.300
And in many ways, the actions
we take in the months ahead will

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.166
help determine what kind
of country we want to be,

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:02.100
and what kind of world we want
our children and grandchildren

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.667
to grow up in.

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:07.100
As President, I promise to do
everything I can to make America

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.900
a place where hard work and
responsibility are rewarded --

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.533
one where everyone has a
fair shot and everyone does

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.066
their fair share.

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:17.000
That's the America I believe in.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.166
That's the America
we've always known.

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:21.266
And I'm confident that
if we work together,

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:24.934
and if you keep reminding folks
in Washington what's at stake,

00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:27.767
then we will move this country
forward and guarantee every

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:30.967
American the opportunities
they deserve.

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:33.667
Thanks for watching,
and from Michelle, Malia,

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:37.266
Sasha and Bo, as well as
myself, Happy New Year.
