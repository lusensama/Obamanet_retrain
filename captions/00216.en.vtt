00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:09.033
The President:
I'm speaking to you from the
bridge of the aircraft carrier

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:11.734
USS Carl Vinson in San Diego.

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:13.667
This is one of the
biggest ships in the Navy,

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:16.500
and on Friday it was home to
one of the most unique college

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.533
basketball games I've ever seen.

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.467
It also gave members of our
military and our veterans a

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:25.834
chance to unwind a little bit,
and on this Veterans Day,

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:28.867
I want to take this opportunity
to thank all our men and women

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:32.800
in uniform for their
service and their sacrifice.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.500
But this day isn't just
about thanking our veterans.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.300
It's about rededicating
ourselves to serving our

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.033
veterans as well as
they've served us.

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:44.300
And right now, that's
never been more important.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.934
Last month, I announced
that, as promised,

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:50.300
we will end the war in Iraq
by the end of this year.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.934
Many of our military families
will be welcoming loved ones

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:54.767
home for the holidays.

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:56.900
At the same time, we've
begun to wind down the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.567
war in Afghanistan.

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:01.967
And in the next five years, over
a million service members will

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:06.233
transition back into civilian
life - joining the 3 million who

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:09.300
have already done so
over the last decade.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.400
These are men and women who have
served with distinction in some

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.934
of the most dangerous
places on the planet.

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:17.700
But for many of them, the
challenges don't end when

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.533
they take off the uniform.

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:24.166
Today, more than 850,000
veterans remain unemployed.

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.967
And too many are struggling
to find a job worthy of their

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:29.400
talents and their experience.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.967
That's not right.

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:33.200
We ask these men and women to
leave their families and their

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.500
jobs and risk their lives
to fight for our country.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.333
The last thing they should have
to do is fight for a job when

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.934
they get home.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.467
To give our veterans the
opportunities they've earned,

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:46.300
I've directed the federal
government to lead by example -

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.767
and already, we've
hired 120,000 veterans.

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:52.734
We've also challenged private
companies to hire or train

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:56.867
100,000 post-9/11 veterans
or their spouses by the end

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:58.700
of 2013.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.166
So far, many patriotic companies
have answered the call,

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:05.100
hiring more than
16,000 Americans.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.333
And yesterday, thanks to the
hard work of Michelle and

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:11.266
Dr. Jill Biden, companies
announced their commitment

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:16.633
to train or hire 125,000
more over the next two years.

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:18.734
But we need to do more.

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:20.700
That's why, as part of
the American Jobs Act,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.433
I called on Congress to pass
a Returning Heroes Tax Credit,

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:27.734
which would give businesses a
tax break for each unemployed

00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:31.066
veteran they hire; and a
Wounded Warriors Tax Credit,

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:33.533
which would give businesses
a tax break for hiring an

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:36.333
unemployed veteran with a
disability related to their

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.400
service in uniform.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.433
These proposals will go a long
way towards putting our veterans

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:42.433
back to work.

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:45.066
And on Thursday, I was
pleased to see the Senate

00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:48.734
put partisanship aside and
came together to pass these

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:50.367
tax credits.

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:53.166
After all, standing up for our
veterans isn't a Democratic

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:56.333
responsibility or a Republican
responsibility - it's an

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.467
American responsibility.

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:01.133
It's one that all of us
have an obligation to meet.

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:04.600
And the House should pass this
bill as soon as possible so I

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.066
can sign it into law.

00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:10.300
As Commander-in-Chief, I want
every veteran to know that

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.300
America will always honor your
service and your sacrifice --

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.934
not just today, but every day.

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:19.633
And just as you have fought for
us, we're going to keep fighting

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:23.433
for you - for more
jobs, for more security,

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:26.900
for the opportunity to keep your
families strong and America

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.800
competitive in the 21st century.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.200
So to all our veterans -
thank you for your service.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.333
God bless you.

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:37.400
And may God bless the
United States of America.
