00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.200
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.934
Over the last few years,
Democrats and Republicans have

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:12.033
come together and cut
our deficit by more than

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:17.066
$2.5 trillion through a balanced
mix of spending cuts and higher

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.633
tax rates for the
wealthiest Americans.

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:22.600
That's more than halfway towards
the $4 trillion in deficit

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.133
reductions that economists and
elected officials from both

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:29.066
parties say we need
to stabilize our debt.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:32.400
I believe we can finish the job
the same way we started it --

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.033
with a balanced mix of
more spending cuts and more

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:36.367
tax reform.

00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:39.934
And the overwhelming majority
of the American people agree --

00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:42.900
both Democrats and Republicans.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.600
Now, my preference -- and the
preference of many Members of

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.233
Congress -- is to do that in
a balanced, comprehensive way,

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:53.233
by making sensible changes
to entitlement programs and

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:55.700
reforming our tax code.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.500
As we speak, both the House
and Senate are working towards

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.767
budget proposals that I hope
will lay out this kind of

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:03.300
balanced path going forward.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.433
But the budget
process takes time.

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:09.333
And right now, if Congress
doesn't act by March 1st,

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.967
a series of harmful, automatic
cuts to job-creating investments

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:16.467
and defense spending -- also
known as the sequester --

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:18.600
are scheduled to take effect.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.000
And the result could be a huge
blow to middle-class families

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and our economy as a whole.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.333
If the sequester is
allowed to go forward,

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.700
thousands of Americans who
work in fields like national

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.033
security, education or
clean energy are likely to

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:33.500
be laid off.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.533
Firefighters and food inspectors
could also find themselves out

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.633
of work -- leaving our
communities vulnerable.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.433
Programs like Head
Start would be cut,

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:44.433
and lifesaving research into
diseases like cancer and

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:47.200
Alzheimer's could
be scaled back.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.433
Small businesses could be
prevented from getting the

00:01:49.433 --> 00:01:53.834
resources and support they
need to keep their doors open.

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:56.600
People with disabilities who are
waiting for their benefits could

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.100
be forced to wait even longer.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.667
All our economic progress
could be put at risk.

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:05.533
And then there's the impact
on our military readiness.

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:08.533
Already, the threat of deep cuts
has forced the Navy to delay an

00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:10.834
aircraft carrier that was
supposed to deploy to the

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:12.500
Persian Gulf.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.767
As our military leaders
have made clear,

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:18.200
changes like this affect our
ability to respond to threats in

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.333
an unstable part of the world.

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:23.000
And we'll be forced to make
even more tough decisions in the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.433
weeks ahead if
Congress fails to act.

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:29.300
The good news is,
there's another option.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.300
Two months ago, we faced
a similar deadline,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.166
and instead of making deep,
indiscriminate cuts that would

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:37.400
have cost jobs and
slowed down our recovery,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.467
Democrats and Republicans came
together and made responsible

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:44.333
cuts and manageable changes to
our tax code that will bring

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:46.500
down our deficit.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.900
This time, Congress should pass
a similar set of balanced cuts

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.800
and close more tax loopholes
until they can find a way to

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.166
replace the sequester with a
smarter, longer-term solution.

00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:59.600
Right now, most
Members of Congress --

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.734
including many Republicans --
don't think it's a good idea to

00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:05.834
put thousands of jobs at risk
and do unnecessary damage to

00:03:05.834 --> 00:03:07.233
our economy.

00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:09.967
And yet the current Republican
plan puts the burden of avoiding

00:03:09.967 --> 00:03:13.800
those cuts mainly on seniors
and middle-class families.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.700
They'd rather ask more from the
vast majority of Americans and

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.266
put our recovery at risk than
close even a single tax loophole

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:23.700
that benefits the wealthy.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.200
Over the last few years, we've
made good progress towards

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.033
reducing our deficit
in a balanced way.

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:31.734
There's no reason we can't keep
chipping away at this problem.

00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:34.333
And there's certainly no reason
that middle-class families and

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:37.800
small businesses should suffer
just because Washington couldn't

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.433
come together and eliminate
a few special interest tax

00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:44.500
loopholes, or government
programs that just don't work.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.100
At a time when economists and
business leaders from across the

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.633
spectrum have said that our
economy is poised for progress,

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:53.767
we shouldn't allow
self-inflicted wounds to put

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:56.000
that progress in jeopardy.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.033
So my message to
Congress is this:

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:01.133
Let's keep working together
to solve this problem.

00:04:01.133 --> 00:04:04.166
And let's give our workers and
our businesses the support they

00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:07.300
need to grow and to thrive.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.300
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
