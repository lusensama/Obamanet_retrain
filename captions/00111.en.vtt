00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.200
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.667
Yesterday, we learned
that in 2013,

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:17.834
our businesses created
2.2 million new jobs -

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:20.600
including 87,000 last month.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.967
Our unemployment rate
is the lowest it has been

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:24.567
since October 2008.

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:28.800
And across our broader economy,
there are signs of progress.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
Our manufacturing and housing
sectors are rebounding.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.667
Our energy, technology,
and auto sectors are booming.

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:38.500
Thanks in part to the reforms
in the Affordable Care Act,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.100
health care costs now eat up
less of our economy -

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.100
over the past four years,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.300
costs have grown at
the slowest rate on record.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.567
And since I took office,

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:50.934
we've cut our deficits
by more than half.

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:52.667
Thanks to the
hard work and sacrifice

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:53.734
of the American people,

00:00:53.734 --> 00:00:55.600
our economy is
growing stronger.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.934
But we know we've got
more work to do together.

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.500
Our success as a country depends
on more than the success

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.967
of our broader economy -

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:07.834
it depends on the success
of the American people.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.633
It depends on your
ability to make ends meet,

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:14.300
provide for your families,
and, with a little hard work,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.500
feel like you can get ahead.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.333
So we've got to keep
our economy growing,

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.700
and make sure more Americans
have the opportunity

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.767
to share in that growth.

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:25.600
We've got to keep creating
jobs that offer new opportunity,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600
and make sure those jobs offer
the wages and benefits

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.967
that let you rebuild
some security.

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:33.800
We've got more kids to educate,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.900
and families to get covered
with health insurance,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.734
and an immigration
system to fix.

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:43.734
And we've got to make sure this
recovery leaves no one behind.

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:46.166
This will be a year of action.

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.734
I'll keep doing everything
I can to create new jobs

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:51.934
and new opportunities
for American families -

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:55.166
with Congress, on my own,

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:58.367
and with everyone willing
to play their part.

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:01.667
And that action should begin by
extending unemployment insurance

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:03.734
for Americans who were
laid off in the recession

00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:06.133
through no fault of their own.

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:08.166
This vital economic
lifeline helps people

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:11.667
support their families
while they look for a new job.

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:14.667
And it demands responsibility
in return by requiring

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.400
that they prove they're
actively looking for work.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.734
But before the holidays,

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:21.433
Republicans in Congress
just let that lifeline expire

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.834
for 1.3 million Americans.

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:26.433
And if this doesn't get fixed,
it will actually hurt

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:30.900
about 14 million Americans
over the course of this year.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.166
Earlier this week,

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:33.667
Democrats and
Republicans in the Senate

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:36.166
took the first steps
toward making this right.

00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:38.900
But Congress needs to
finish the job right away.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.166
More than one million
Americans across the country

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:43.300
will feel a little
hope right away.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.633
Working folks are looking
for the kind of stable,

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:50.333
secure jobs that went overseas
in the past couple decades.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:53.367
So next week, I'll join
companies and colleges

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:56.000
and take action to boost
the high-tech manufacturing

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.033
that attracts the
kind of good new jobs

00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:00.800
a growing middle
class requires.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.567
Business owners are
ready to play their part

00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:03.700
and hire more workers.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.200
So next week, I'll be joined by
college presidents as we lay out

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.967
specific steps we can take
to help more workers

00:03:10.967 --> 00:03:14.600
earn the skills they need
for today's new jobs.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.066
Later this month I'll host CEOs
at the White House

00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:18.367
to announce commitments
we're making

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:21.400
to put more of the long-term 
unemployed back to work.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.667
And at the end of the month,

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:25.133
in my State
of the Union Address,

00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:28.066
I will mobilize the country
around the national mission

00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:31.600
of making sure our economy offers 
everyone who works hard

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.367
a fair shot at
opportunity and success.

00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:37.633
As Americans,
that's what we should expect.

00:03:37.633 --> 00:03:39.667
And after everything
you've done to recover

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:43.066
and rebuild from crisis
these past five years -

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:45.667
after all your
hard work and sacrifice -

00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:47.633
that's what you deserve.

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:49.667
Thanks,
and have a great weekend.
