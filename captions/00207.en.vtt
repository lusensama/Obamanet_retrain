00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:10.934
The President:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:14.734
On Thursday, I went down to
Florida to visit Disneyworld.

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:16.834
And to Sasha and Malia's
great disappointment,

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:19.433
I was not there to hang out
with Mickey or ride the

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:20.934
Space Mountain.

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:23.333
Instead, I was there to talk
about steps we're taking to

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.233
boost tourism and create jobs.

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:29.967
Tourism is the number
one service we export.

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:32.600
Every year, tens of millions of
tourists come from all over the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.166
world to visit America.

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.233
They stay in our hotels,
eat at our restaurants,

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:41.567
and see all the sights
America has to offer.

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:43.734
That's good for
local businesses.

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:45.633
That's good for local economies.

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:47.734
And the more folks
who visit America,

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:50.600
the more Americans
we get back to work.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.433
It's that simple.

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:54.734
We can't wait to seize
this opportunity.

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:58.166
As I've said before, I will
continue to work with Congress,

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:01.500
states, and leaders in the
private sector to find ways to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.467
move this country forward.

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:06.867
But where they can't act
or won't act, I will.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:09.100
Because we want the world
to know that America is open

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.400
for business.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.867
And that's why I announced steps
we're taking to promote America

00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:17.266
and make it easier for
tourists to come and visit.

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:20.066
Frequent travelers who pass an
extensive background check will

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.934
be able to scan their passports
and fingerprints and skip the

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:26.133
long lines at immigration
at more airports.

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.467
We're going to expand the number
of countries where visitors can

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:31.400
get pre-cleared by Homeland
Security so they don't need a

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.633
tourist visa.

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:35.467
And we're going to speed up visa
processing for countries with

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:38.734
growing middle classes that
can afford to visit America --

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:41.400
countries like China and Brazil.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.567
We want more
visitors coming here.

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:45.433
We want them
spending money here.

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:48.266
It's good for our economy, and
it will help provide the boost

00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:51.633
more businesses need
to grow and to hire.

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.967
And we can't wait
to make it happen.

00:01:53.967 --> 00:01:55.500
Too often over the
last few months,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.600
we've seen Congress drag its
feet and refuse to take steps we

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.133
know will help
strengthen our economy.

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:04.033
That's why this is the latest in
a series of actions I've taken

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:08.500
on my own to help our economy
keep growing, creating jobs,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.033
and restoring security
for middle-class families.

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:14.633
In September, we decided to stop
waiting for Congress to fix No

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:17.800
Child Left Behind and give
states the flexibility they need

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.533
to help our kids meet
higher standards.

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.967
We made sure that small
businesses that have contracts

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:25.600
with the federal government
can get paid faster so they can

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.633
start hiring more people.

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:30.300
We made it easier for veterans
to get jobs and put their

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.734
skills to work.

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:34.834
We took steps to help families
whose home values have fallen

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:37.667
to refinance their mortgages
and save up to thousands of

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:39.233
dollars a year.

00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:41.767
We sped up the loan process for
companies that want to rebuild

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:44.467
our roads and bridges -- putting
construction workers back

00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:45.967
on the job.

00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:48.467
And I appointed Richard Cordray
to be America's consumer

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:51.633
watchdog and protect working
Americans from the worst abuses

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:53.734
of the financial industry.

00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:55.600
These are good steps.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.400
Now we need to do more.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.900
On Tuesday evening, I'll deliver
my State of the Union Address,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.767
where I'll lay out my blueprint
for actions we need to take

00:03:02.767 --> 00:03:07.266
together -- not just me, or
Congress, but every American --

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:09.967
to rebuild an economy where
hard work and responsibility

00:03:09.967 --> 00:03:11.433
are rewarded.

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:13.934
An economy that's built to last.

00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:15.467
I hope you'll tune in.

00:03:15.467 --> 00:03:17.734
In the meantime, I'm going to
keep doing everything I can to

00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:19.900
make this country not only
the best place to visit and do

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.633
business -- but the best place
to live and to work and build a

00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:26.066
better life.

00:03:26.066 --> 00:03:27.066
Thanks for watching.

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:28.066
Have a great weekend.

00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:29.333
And I'll see you on Tuesday.
