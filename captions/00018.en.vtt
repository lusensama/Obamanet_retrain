00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.545
The President:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.881
This week, Americans across
our country have shown what

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:18.051
it means to be strong in
the face of terrorism.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:21.121
In San Bernardino, even as
the community continues to

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:25.425
grieve, people are refusing
to be ruled by fear.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.894
Across the county, dedicated
public servants are on the

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:31.531
job - and more will be
returning to work this week.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.400
Faith communities have come
together in fellowship

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.968
and prayer.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.937
Families lined the streets
for the annual children's

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:41.541
Christmas parade-because we
can't let terrorists change

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.777
how we live our lives.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:46.146
Meanwhile, our men and women
in uniform are stepping up

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.748
our campaign to
destroy ISIL.

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:50.950
Our airstrikes are hitting
ISIL harder than ever,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.719
in Iraq and Syria.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.988
We're taking out more of
their fighters and leaders,

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:57.590
their weapons,
their oil tankers.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.125
Our Special Operations
Forces are on the

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:01.060
ground, because we're
going to hunt down these

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.930
terrorists wherever
they try to hide.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.433
In recent weeks, our strikes
have taken out the ISIL

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:09.369
finance chief, a terrorist
leader in Somalia and the

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.538
ISIL leader in Libya.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:14.040
Our message to these killers
is simple.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.408
We will find you,

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:18.378
and justice will be done.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:21.314
This week, we'll move
forward on all fronts.

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:22.882
On Monday, I'll go
to the Pentagon.

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:24.951
And there, I'll review our
military campaign and how we

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:28.388
can continue to
accelerate our efforts.

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:29.589
Later in the week,
I'll go to

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.891
the National Counterterrorism Center.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.527
There, I'll review our
efforts across our entire

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.196
government to prevent
attacks

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.298
and protect our homeland.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:39.632
And this week, the
Department of Homeland

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:42.368
Security will update its
alert system to ensure

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.370
Americans get
more information,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.173
including steps that you and
your communities can take to

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:50.143
be vigilant and
to stay safe.

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:53.112
In the wake of the attacks
in Paris and San Bernardino,

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:56.115
I know a lot of Americans
are asking "what can I do?"

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:59.619
First, as always, we
have to stay vigilant.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.188
If you see something
that seems suspicious,

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.624
say something to
law enforcement.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.593
Over the years, plots have
been uncovered because

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:10.230
someone saw something
and spoke up.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.865
As I said in my
speech last weekend,

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:14.434
one of the most important
things we can do is to stay

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:17.237
true to who we
are as Americans.

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:19.806
Terrorists like ISIL are
trying to divide us along

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.041
lines of religion
and background.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.743
That's how they stoke fear.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:25.378
That's how they recruit.

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:28.081
And just as Muslims around
the world have to keep

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:31.684
rejecting any twisted
interpretation of Islam,

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:36.055
all of us have to reject
bigotry in all of its forms.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:39.626
I'll say it again, prejudice
and discrimination helps

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:43.396
ISIL and it undermines
our national security.

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.131
The good news is that
Americans are coming

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:49.302
together to reaffirm the
core values that keep us strong.

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:52.105
Political leaders across
the spectrum, Democrats and

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:55.341
Republicans, liberals and
conservatives, are standing

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.745
up, forcefully, for
freedom of religion.

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.647
Churches and synagogues
are reaching out to local

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:05.351
mosques, reminding us that
we are all God's children.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.854
Grateful citizens are saying
thank you to our patriotic

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:11.224
Muslim American service
members and veterans.

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:13.726
Some of our greatest sports
heroes have reminded us why

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:17.430
they're true champions, and
voices for tolerance

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.432
and understanding.

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:21.467
Across the country,
Americans are reaching

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:25.672
out to their Muslim friends,
neighbors and coworkers, to

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:28.975
let them know we're
here for each other.

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:30.810
I think of the woman in
Texas carrying a sign

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.847
saying, "We love our
Muslim neighbors."

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.783
That's the message I hope
every Muslim American

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:40.587
hears, that we're all part
of the same American family.

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:43.489
And it's a message all of us
can deliver.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.291
Parents to our children,

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:47.393
teachers
to their students,

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:51.331
leaders in politics and
business and entertainment.

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.666
Back in San Bernardino,
people from across the

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:56.269
community have joined in
prayer vigils.

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.238
Christians, Jews, Muslims and others.

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:01.374
They've sent a powerful
message.

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:02.976
We're all in this together.

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:05.712
That's the spirit
we have to uphold.

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:08.214
That's what we can do as
Americans,

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:11.317
united in defense of the country that we love.
