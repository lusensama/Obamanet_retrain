00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.344
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:14.547
This week, after five years
of effort with eleven other

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:17.450
nations, we reached
agreement on a new trade

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.353
deal that promotes American
values and protects

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.122
American workers.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.758
There's a reason this
Trans-Pacific Partnership

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.960
took five years
to negotiate.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.162
I wanted to get the best
possible deal for

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.597
American workers.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:32.232
And that is what we've done.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.367
Here's why it matters.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.303
Ninety-five percent of the
world's consumers live

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:40.173
outside our borders
-- 95 percent.

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:42.542
They want to buy
American products.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.178
They want our cars;
our music; our food.

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:47.747
And if American businesses
can sell more of their

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:51.151
products in those markets,
they can expand and support

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.052
good jobs here at home.

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:55.922
So it's no wonder that
exports played a huge role

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:59.058
in helping America recover
from the Great Recession.

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:01.628
In fact, last year, we set
a new record for American

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:04.164
exports for the fifth year
in a row, selling more than

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:06.900
$2 trillion in
goods and services.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.104
Our exports support roughly
12 million American jobs --

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.006
and they're jobs that
typically pay better than

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.374
other jobs.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:18.445
But here's the thing:
Outdated trade rules put our

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.346
workers at a disadvantage.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:23.216
And TPP will change that.

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:26.119
Right now, other countries
can cut their costs by

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.589
setting lower standards
to pay lower wages.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:33.460
This trade agreement, TPP,
will change that, holding

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.063
partner countries to higher
standards and raising wages

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.666
across a region that makes
up nearly 40 percent of the

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.334
global economy.

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:44.604
Right now, other countries
charge foreign taxes on

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.873
goods that are
made in America.

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:50.143
Japan, for example, puts a
38 percent tax on American

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:53.580
beef before it even
reaches the market.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.516
Malaysia puts a 30 percent
tax on American auto parts.

00:01:56.516 --> 00:02:00.286
Vietnam puts taxes as high
as 70 percent on every car

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:03.022
American automakers
sell there.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:06.593
Those taxes and other trade
barriers put our workers at

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:08.461
a disadvantage.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.598
It makes it more expensive
to make goods here and sell

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:13.099
them over there.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.734
Well, TPP is going
to change that.

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:17.804
It eliminates more than
18,000 of these taxes on

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:21.407
American goods and services.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:24.210
And that way, we're boosting
America's farmers, ranchers,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.546
manufacturers, and small
business owners -- make it

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:30.483
easier for them to sell
their products abroad.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:33.019
That's what it means to
level the playing field for

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.854
American workers
and businesses.

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:36.556
And when the playing field
is level, and the rules are

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:39.926
fair, Americans can
out-compete anybody

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:41.294
in the world.

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:45.231
Now, I'm the first person
who will say that past trade

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:48.468
agreements haven't always
lived up to their promise.

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:51.771
Sometimes they've been
tilted too much in the

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:55.842
direction of other countries
and we haven't gotten a

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.310
fair deal.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.345
And that makes folks
suspicious of any new

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:00.580
trade initiatives.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.681
But let's be clear.

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.951
Our future depends not on
what past trade deals did

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:08.154
wrong, but on doing
new trade deals right.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.323
And that's what
the TPP does.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:13.593
It includes the strongest
labor standards in history,

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:15.895
from requiring fair hours to
prohibiting child labor and

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:17.297
forced labor.

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:19.599
It includes the strongest
environmental standards

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:20.934
in history.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:24.537
All these things level
the playing field for us,

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.639
because if they have to
follow these rules, then

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.476
they can't undercut us and
sell their products cheaper

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.979
because they're
violating these rules.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.748
And unlike past trade
agreements, these standards

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:38.051
are actually enforceable.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.854
Without this agreement,
competitors that don't share

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:43.923
our values, like China,
will write the rules of the

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:45.058
global economy.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.994
They'll keep selling into
our markets and try to lure

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:51.864
companies over there;
meanwhile they're going to

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:54.067
keep their markets
closed to us.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.135
That's what's been going
on for the last 20 years.

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:58.838
That's what's contributed
so much to outsourcing.

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:02.642
That's what has made it
easier for them to compete

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:03.710
against us.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.244
And it needs to change.

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:07.780
With this Trans-Pacific
Partnership, we are writing

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.649
the rules for the
global economy.

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.251
America is leading
in the 21st century.

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:15.421
Our workers will be
the ones who get ahead.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.757
Our businesses will
get a fair deal.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:21.227
And those who oppose passing
this new trade deal are

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:23.529
really just accepting a
status quo that everyone

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.265
knows puts us at
a disadvantage.

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:29.702
Look, you don't have
to take my word for it.

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.771
In the coming weeks and
months, you'll be able to

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:34.707
read every word of this
agreement online well before

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:35.808
I sign it.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:38.177
You'll be able to see for
yourself how this agreement

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:40.580
is better than past trade
deals -- and how it's better

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.782
for America's
working families.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.585
You can learn more
at WhiteHouse.gov.

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.153
And I look forward to
working with both parties in

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:50.390
Congress to approve this
deal -- and grow our economy

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.758
for decades to come.

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:53.393
Thanks, everybody.

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:54.594
And have a great weekend.
