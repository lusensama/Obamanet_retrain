The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.080
On Friday, I had a
discussion with working

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.449
women in Rhode Island about
the economic challenges

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.685
they face in their own
lives -- challenges

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.754
shared by many of you.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.922
Thanks to the work
we've all put in,

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:26.025
our economy has come a long
way these past six years.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.628
Over the past 55 months,
our businesses have added

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.331
10.3 million new jobs.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.533
For the first time in six
years, the unemployment rate

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.535
is below 6 percent.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.638
And on Thursday, we learned
that over the past six months,

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:43.476
our economy has grown at its
fastest pace since 2003.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:46.479
But the gains of a growing
economy aren't yet

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.647
felt by everyone.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:49.949
So we've got to
harness this momentum,

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.652
and make the right choices
so that everyone who works

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:54.721
hard can get ahead.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.056
In recent weeks, I've
talked about these choices,

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:59.058
from raising the minimum
wage to creating

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:02.095
new jobs in construction
and manufacturing.

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:05.165
Today, I want to focus on what
I discussed with those women --

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.133
the choices we need
to make to help more

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.036
women get ahead in
today's economy.

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:13.406
Right now, women make up
almost half of our workers.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.742
More women are their
family's main breadwinner

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.510
than ever before.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.481
So the simple truth is, when
women succeed, America succeeds.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.983
And we should be choosing
policies that benefit women --

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.719
because that
benefits all of us.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.788
Women deserve fair pay.

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:31.991
Even though it's 2014, there
are women still earning

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:34.928
less than men for
doing the same work.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.297
We don't have second-class
citizens in this country --

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:39.299
we shouldn't in the
workplace, either.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.301
So let's make sure women
earn equal pay for

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.736
equal work, and have a
fair shot at success.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:47.340
Women deserve to be able to
take time off to care for

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.977
a new baby, an ailing
parent, or take a sick day

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:53.680
for themselves without
running into hardship.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.782
So let's make sure all
Americans have access

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.685
to paid family leave.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.821
Pregnant workers deserve
to be treated fairly.

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:04.791
Even today, women can be fired
for taking too many bathroom

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:08.895
breaks, or forced on unpaid
leave just for being pregnant.

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:12.165
That's wrong -- and we have to
choose policies that ensure

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:16.769
pregnant workers are treated
with dignity and respect.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.006
New parents deserve quality,
affordable childcare.

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:21.975
There's nothing like the
peace of mind that comes with

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.444
knowing that your kids are
safe while you're at work.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:26.980
And the benefits that
children get out of early

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.649
enrichment can pay
off for a lifetime.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.485
But in many states, sending your
kid to daycare costs more

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:35.522
than sending them to a
public university.

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:39.926
So let's start demanding
Pre-K for our kids.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:42.562
And when most low-wage
workers are women,

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:45.365
but Congress hasn't passed a
minimum wage increase in seven

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:50.203
years, it's long past time
that women deserve a raise.

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:52.939
About 28 million workers would
benefit from an increase

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.643
in the minimum wage to ten
dollars and ten cents an hour.

00:02:56.643 --> 00:03:00.346
And more than half of
those workers are women.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.348
The local businesses
where these workers spend

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:03.550
their money would
benefit, too.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.820
So let's do this -- let's
give America a raise.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.356
All of these policies
are common sense.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.725
All of them are
within our reach.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:15.628
We've just got to speak
up and choose them.

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:19.465
Because they'll build a
stronger America for all of us.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.501
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
