00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.479
Hi everybody.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.481
As I said in my State
of the Union address,

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:17.183
we live in a time of
extraordinary change -

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:20.820
change that's affecting the
way we live and the way we work.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.123
New technology replaces
any job where work

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.924
can be automated.

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:27.794
Workers need more
skills to get ahead.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.829
These changes aren't new,
and they're only going

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:30.830
to accelerate.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.999
So the question we have
to ask ourselves is,

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.702
"How can we make sure
everyone has a fair shot at

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.605
success in this
new economy?"

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:42.142
The answer to that question
starts with education.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.344
That's why my Administration
has encouraged states to

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:45.345
raise standards.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:49.816
We've cut the digital divide
in our classrooms in half.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:52.786
We've worked with Congress
to pass a bipartisan bill to

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.522
set the expectation that
every student should

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.524
graduate from high school
ready for college

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:59.259
and a good job.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:02.095
And thanks to the hard work
of students, teachers,

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.030
and parents across
the country,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.234
our high school graduation
rate is at an all-time high.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.904
Now we have to make sure all
our kids are equipped for

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.206
the jobs of the future -
which means not just being

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.708
able to work with computers,
but developing the

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:20.046
analytical and coding skills
to power our innovation economy.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.348
Today's auto mechanics
aren't just sliding under

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:25.051
cars to change the oil;
they're working on machines

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:29.255
that run on as many as 100
million lines of code.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.926
That's 100 times more
than the Space Shuttle.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.895
Nurses are analyzing data
and managing electronic

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.130
health records.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.599
Machinists are writing
computer programs.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.435
And workers of all kinds
need to be able to figure

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:45.772
out how to break a big
problem into smaller pieces

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.808
and identify the right
steps to solve it.

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:52.111
In the new economy, computer
science isn't an optional

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:54.981
skill - it's a basic skill,
right along

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:56.850
with the three "Rs."

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.752
Nine out of ten parents
want it taught at their

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:01.754
children's schools.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:04.624
Yet right now, only about a
quarter of our K through 12

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.160
schools offer
computer science.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.329
Twenty-two states don't even
allow it to count

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.231
toward a diploma.

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:14.534
So I've got a plan to help
make sure all our kids get

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.836
an opportunity to learn
computer science,

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:19.172
especially girls
and minorities.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:21.674
It's called Computer
Science For All.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:24.677
And it means just what it
says - giving every student

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.914
in America an early start at
learning the skills they'll

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:30.850
need to get ahead
in the new economy.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.553
First, I'm asking Congress
to provide funding over the

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:35.588
next three years so that
our elementary, middle,

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:38.157
and high schools can provide
opportunities to learn

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:40.159
computer science
for all students.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.962
Second, starting this year,
we're leveraging existing

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.932
resources at the National
Science Foundation and the

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:49.135
Corporation for National and
Community Service to train

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:51.170
more great teachers
for these courses.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.008
And third, I'll be pulling
together governors, mayors,

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.744
business leaders, and tech
entrepreneurs to join the

00:02:57.744 --> 00:03:00.813
growing bipartisan movement
around this cause.

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:03.049
Americans of all kinds are getting involved, from

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.685
students teaching eachother to code, to teachers

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.054
adding programming
to their classes.

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:11.124
And just today, states
like Delaware and Hawaii,

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.326
companies like Google
and SalesForce,

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.962
and organizations like
Code.org have made

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:19.499
commitments to help more of
our kids learn these skills.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.035
That's what this is all
about - each of us doing our

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.537
part to make sure all our
young people can compete in

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:27.106
a high-tech, global economy.

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:32.345
They're the ones who will
make sure America keeps

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:35.248
growing, keeps innovating,
and keeps leading the world

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:36.916
in the years ahead.

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:39.252
And they're the reason I've
never been more confident

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:40.954
about our future.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:46.392
Thanks everybody, and
have a great weekend.
