00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.767
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:09.700
This week, I welcomed President
Hamid Karzai to the White House

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.900
to discuss the way
ahead in Afghanistan.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.133
And today, I want to update you
on how we will end this war,

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.867
bring our troops home,
and continue the work of

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:20.934
rebuilding America.

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:24.066
Over the past four years, thanks
to our brave men and women in

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:27.800
uniform, we've dealt
devastating blows to al Qaeda.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.767
We've pushed the Taliban
out of their strongholds.

00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:33.834
And our core objective -- the
reason we went to war in the

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.400
first place -- is
now within reach:

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.266
ensuring that al Qaeda can never
again use Afghanistan to launch

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.700
attacks against America.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.667
The 33,000 additional forces
that I ordered to Afghanistan

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:50.266
served with honor; they
completed their mission, and --

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.633
as promised -- returned
home last fall.

00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:56.000
This week, we agreed
that this spring,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.133
Afghan forces will take the lead
for security across the entire

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:03.500
country, and our troops will
shift to a support role.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.967
In the coming months, I'll
announce the next phase of

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:07.133
our drawdown.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.700
And by the end of next year,
America's war in Afghanistan

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.100
will be over.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.934
This progress has only been
possible because of the heroic

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:17.767
sacrifices of our
troops and diplomats,

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:20.767
alongside forces from
many other nations.

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:22.567
More than a half
million Americans --

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:26.100
military and civilian --
have served in Afghanistan.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.233
Thousands have been wounded.

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:31.467
More than 2,000 have
given their lives.

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:33.867
This remains a very
difficult mission.

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:36.066
The work ahead will not be easy.

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.967
Our forces are
still in harm's way.

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:42.166
But make no mistake -- our
path is clear, and we are

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.700
moving forward.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.166
Because after more
than a decade of war,

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:49.867
the nation we need to
rebuild is our own.

00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:54.166
As we do, we have to care for
our troops and veterans who

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.033
fought in our name.

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:59.600
We have to grow our economy
and shrink our deficits.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.633
Create new jobs and
boost family incomes.

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:04.533
We have to fix our
infrastructure and our

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:06.500
immigration system.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.400
We have to protect our planet
from the destructive effects of

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.066
climate change -- and protect
our children from the horrors of

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.033
gun violence.

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:18.300
These, too, will be difficult
missions for America.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.133
But they must be met.

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:24.000
And if we can summon just a
fraction of the determination of

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.600
our men and women in uniform,
I know we can meet them.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.000
And I intend to work as hard as
I know how to make sure we do.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.133
Thank you.
