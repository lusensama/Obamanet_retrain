00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:08.066
The President:
It has now been three months
since the tragic events in

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.967
Newtown, Connecticut.

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:13.633
Three months since we lost
20 innocent children and six

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:17.033
dedicated adults who had
so much left to give.

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:19.066
Three months since
we, as Americans,

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:22.467
began asking ourselves if we're
really doing enough to protect

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:25.767
our communities and
keep our children safe.

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:29.133
For the families who lost a
loved one on that terrible day,

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.533
three months doesn't even
begin to ease the pain they're

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.533
feeling right now.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.834
It doesn't come close to mending
the wounds that may never

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:38.567
fully heal.

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:43.000
But as a nation, the last
three months have changed us.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.567
They've forced us to answer some
difficult questions about what

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:49.633
we can do -- what we must do
-- to prevent the kinds of

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:53.934
massacres we've seen in Newtown
and Aurora and Oak Creek,

00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:56.400
as well as the everyday
tragedies that happen far too

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.333
often in big cities and small
towns all across America.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.900
Today there is still genuine
disagreement among well-meaning

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.300
people about what steps we
should take to reduce the

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.233
epidemic of gun violence
in this country.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:11.867
But you -- the American
people -- have spoken.

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:14.734
You've made it clear that
it's time to do something.

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:17.533
And over the last few weeks,
senators here in Washington have

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.867
listened and taken
some big steps forward.

00:01:20.867 --> 00:01:23.367
Two weeks ago, the Senate
advanced a bill that would make

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:25.834
it harder for criminals and
people with a severe mental

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:28.600
illness from getting
their hands on a gun --

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.800
an idea supported by nine
out of ten Americans,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.500
including a majority
of gun owners.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.133
The Senate also made progress on
a bill that would crack down on

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:40.367
anyone who buys a gun as part
of a scheme to funnel it to

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.934
criminals -- reducing violent
crime and protecting our law

00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:46.000
enforcement officers.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.467
Finally, the Senate took steps
to reinstate and strengthen a

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:53.233
ban on the sale of
military-style assault weapons,

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:56.200
set a 10-round
limit for magazines,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.600
and make our schools
safer places for kids to

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.667
learn and to grow.

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:02.867
These ideas shouldn't
be controversial --

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:04.600
they're common sense.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.400
They're supported by a majority
of the American people.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.333
And I urge the Senate and
the House to give each of

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:12.333
them a vote.

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:15.567
As I've said before, we may not
be able to prevent every act of

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:17.500
violence in this country.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.500
But together, we have
an obligation to try.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.533
We have an obligation
to do what we can.

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:26.467
Right now, we have a real
chance to reduce gun violence in

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:30.166
America, and prevent
the very worst violence.

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:33.467
We have a unique opportunity
to reaffirm our tradition of

00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:37.000
responsible gun ownership, and
also do more to keep guns out of

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.367
the hands of criminals or people
with a severe mental illness.

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:43.767
We've made progress over
the last three months,

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:45.633
but we're not there yet.

00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:48.633
And in the weeks ahead, I hope
Members of Congress will join me

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:52.300
in finishing the job --
for our communities and,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.233
most importantly, for our kids.

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:56.233
Thanks.
