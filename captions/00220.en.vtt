00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:09.233
The President:
Next week, the Senate will
vote on the American Jobs Act.

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.667
It's a bill that will put more
people to work and put more

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.266
money in the pockets
of working Americans.

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.767
And it will provide our economy
with the jolt that it really

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:18.800
needs right now.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.133
This is not the time for the
usual games or political

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.200
gridlock in Washington.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.967
The challenges facing financial
markets around the world could

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:29.467
have very real effects on our
own economy at a time when it's

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:31.100
already fragile.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.100
But this jobs bill can help
guard against another downturn

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.734
here in America.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.567
This isn't just my belief --
it's what independent economists

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:41.100
have said -- not
just politicians,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.500
not just people in
my administration --

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500
independent experts who do this
for a living have said that this

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.233
jobs bill will have a
significant effect for our

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:52.900
economy and middle-class
families all across America.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.333
But if we don't act, the
opposite will be true --

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.000
there will be fewer
jobs and weaker growth.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.367
So any senator out there who's
thinking about voting against

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:04.900
this jobs bill needs to explain
why they would oppose something

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.033
that we know would improve
our economic situation.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:10.233
If the Republicans in Congress
think they have a better plan

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:13.233
for creating jobs right
now, they should prove it.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:15.133
Because one of the same
independent economists who

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:18.066
looked at our plan just
said that their ideas

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:21.967
"wouldn't mean much for the
economy in the near term."

00:01:21.967 --> 00:01:23.500
If their plan
doesn't measure up,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.367
the American people deserve to
know what it is that Republicans

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:30.000
in Congress don't like
about this jobs plan.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.166
You hear a lot of our Republican
friends say that one of the most

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:35.066
important things we
can do is cut taxes.

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.367
Well, they should
love this plan.

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:40.834
The American Jobs Act would cut
taxes for virtually every worker

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:43.333
and small business in America.

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:46.233
And if you're a small business
owner that hires new workers,

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:51.867
raises wages or hires a veteran,
you get an additional tax cut.

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:54.800
Right now, hundreds of thousands
of teachers and firefighters and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.834
police officers have been
laid off because of state

00:01:57.834 --> 00:01:59.367
budget cuts.

00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:01.633
This jobs bill will put a
lot of these men and women

00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:03.367
back to work.

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:05.900
Right now, there are millions of
laid-off construction workers

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.467
who could be repairing
our bridges and roads,

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:10.700
and modernizing our schools.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.533
Why wouldn't we want to put
these men and women to work

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.700
rebuilding America?

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.300
The proposals in this bill are
steps we have to take if we want

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.700
to build an economy that lasts;
if we want to be able to compete

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.200
with other countries for jobs
that restore a sense of security

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.200
for the middle class.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.533
But we also have to rein in our
deficit and start living within

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:34.166
our means, which is why this
jobs bill is paid for by asking

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:37.667
millionaires and billionaires
to pay their fair share.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:40.100
Some see this as class warfare.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.266
I see it as a simple choice --
we can either keep taxes exactly

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:46.233
as they are for millionaires
and billionaires,

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:50.200
or we can ask them to pay at
least the same rate as a plumber

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.767
or a bus driver.

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:53.934
And in the process, we can
put teachers and construction

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:57.300
workers and veterans
back on the job.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.200
We can either fight to protect
their tax cuts or we can cut

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.033
taxes for virtually every worker
and small business in America.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:07.533
But we can't afford to do
both -- it's that simple.

00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:09.900
There are too many people
hurting in this country for us

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.300
to simply do nothing.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.867
The economy is too fragile for
us to let politics get in the

00:03:14.867 --> 00:03:16.767
way of action.

00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:20.133
The people who represent you in
Washington have a responsibility

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:24.567
to do what is best for you --
not what's best for their party

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:27.367
or what's going to help them win
an election that's more than a

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:29.000
year away.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.266
So I need you to keep making
your voices heard in Washington.

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:35.767
I need you to remind these
folks who they work for.

00:03:35.767 --> 00:03:38.767
And I need you to tell your
senators to do the right thing

00:03:38.767 --> 00:03:42.166
by passing this jobs
bill right away.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:43.200
Thanks so much.
