00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:09.166
The President:
Last month, our economy added
more than 100,000 private sector

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:13.100
jobs and the unemployment
rate fell sharply.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.967
This follows encouraging
economic news from increased

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:21.000
auto sales to continued
expansion of our manufacturing sector.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.800
Now, we know that these numbers can
bounce around from month to month.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.600
But the trend is clear.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.000
We saw 12 straight months of
private sector job growth --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the first time that's
been true since 2006.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.900
The economy added 1.3
million jobs last year.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.266
And each quarter was
stronger than the last,

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:43.467
which means the pace of
hiring is picking up.

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:46.166
Now we're seeing more optimistic
economic forecasts for the year

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:51.300
ahead, in part due to the
package of tax cuts I signed last month.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.100
I fought for that
package because,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.400
while we are recovering, we
plainly still have a lot of work to do.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.100
The recession rocked the
foundations of our economy,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.133
and left a lot of destruction
and a lot of doubt in its wake.

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.867
So, our fundamental mission must
be to accelerate hiring and

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.333
growth, while we do the things
we know are necessary to ensure

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:14.066
America's leadership in an
increasingly competitive world

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:17.200
and build an economy that will
provide opportunity to any

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.667
American willing to work for it.

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:22.100
I'm absolutely confident
we'll get there.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.967
I'm confident, first and
foremost, because of you;

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:27.867
because the ingenuity of our
entrepreneurs and business

00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:30.800
owners; the tenacity
of our workers;

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.934
and the determination
of the American people.

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:37.667
This is what has made our
economy the envy of the world.

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:40.033
But we have to do everything we
can to help our businesses and

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.967
workers win in this new economy.

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:46.033
Now, yesterday, I visited the
Thompson Creek Window Company,

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:47.967
a small business in Maryland.

00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:52.200
Over the past year, sales there
have grown by 55% thanks,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.800
in part, to an energy
tax credit we created.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.200
And this year, they're also
planning to take advantage of a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.800
new tax incentive
for businesses.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.233
For one year, any
business, large or small,

00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:08.300
can write off the full cost of
most of their capital investments.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.433
This will make it more
affordable for businesses like

00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:14.166
Thompson Creek to
expand and to hire.

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.633
So, if you're a business owner,
I'd encourage you to take

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:19.233
advantage of this
temporary provision.

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:24.333
It will save you money today and
help you grow your business tomorrow.

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:26.800
This incentive is part of the
economic package I signed into

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.000
law last month -- a package that
also includes a payroll tax cut

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.567
that will mean $1,000 more
this year for a typical family.

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:40.300
In fact, 155 million workers
will see larger paychecks this

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.433
month as a result
of this tax cut.

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:47.333
12 million families will benefit
from a $1,000 child tax credit

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:50.166
and an expanded Earned
Income Tax Credit.

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:52.200
Eight million students and
families will continue to

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.667
benefit from a $2,500 tuition tax
credit to make college more affordable.

00:02:57.667 --> 00:03:00.800
And millions of entrepreneurs
in big cities and small towns

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.734
across the country will benefit
not only from the business

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:07.133
expensing plan I mentioned, but
from additional tax cuts that

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:10.100
will spur research
and development.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.000
Independent experts have
concluded that, taken together,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.433
this package of tax cuts will
significantly accelerate the

00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:21.900
pace of our economic recovery,
spurring additional jobs and growth.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.300
And that's our mission.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.800
That should be the focus,
day in and day out,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.200
of our work in Washington
in the coming months,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.467
as we wrestle with a challenging
budget and long-term deficits.

00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:34.767
And I'm determined to
work with everyone,

00:03:34.767 --> 00:03:38.533
Republicans and Democrats,
to achieve that goal.

00:03:38.533 --> 00:03:41.300
What we can't do is refight the
battles of the past two years

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.200
that distract us from the hard
work of moving our economy forward.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.033
What we can't do is engage in
the kinds of symbolic battles

00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:51.834
that so often consume Washington
while the rest of America waits

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:54.133
for us to solve problems.

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:57.066
The tax cuts and other progress
we made in December were a

00:03:57.066 --> 00:03:59.867
much-needed departure
from that pattern.

00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:02.867
Let's build on that admirable
example and do our part,

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:06.633
here in Washington, so that
the doers, the builders,

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:11.700
the innovators in America can do
their best in 2011 and beyond.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.900
Thanks everybody, and
have a great weekend.
