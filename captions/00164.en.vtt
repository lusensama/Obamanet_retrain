00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:10.261
The President:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:12.328
Over the last few weeks,
there's been a lot of talk about

00:00:12.328 --> 00:00:16.661
deadlines we're facing on jobs
and taxes and investments.

00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:19.194
But with so much noise and so
many opinions flying around,

00:00:19.194 --> 00:00:21.394
it can be easy to lose sight
of what this debate is

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:22.961
really about.

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:25.861
It's not about which political
party comes out on top,

00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:28.528
or who wins or
loses in Washington.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.061
It's about making smart
decisions that will have a real

00:00:31.061 --> 00:00:34.661
impact on your lives and the
lives of Americans all across

00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:36.394
the country.

00:00:36.394 --> 00:00:39.661
Right now, middle-class tax cuts
are set to expire at the end

00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:40.928
of the year.

00:00:40.928 --> 00:00:42.428
Time's running out.

00:00:42.428 --> 00:00:45.394
And there are two
things that can happen.

00:00:45.394 --> 00:00:48.795
First, if Congress does nothing,
every family in America will see

00:00:48.795 --> 00:00:52.961
their income taxes automatically
go up on January 1st.

00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:55.194
A typical middle-class
family of four would get a

00:00:55.194 --> 00:00:57.994
$2,200 tax hike.

00:00:57.994 --> 00:01:01.027
That would be bad for families,
it'd be bad for businesses,

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:04.227
and it would drag down
our entire economy.

00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:07.227
Now, Congress can avoid all
of this by passing a law that

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:12.628
prevents a tax hike on the first
$250,000 of everybody's income.

00:01:12.628 --> 00:01:17.528
That means 98% of Americans and
97% of small businesses wouldn't

00:01:17.528 --> 00:01:21.394
see their income taxes
go up by a single dime.

00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:24.361
Even the wealthiest Americans
would get a tax cut on the first

00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:27.361
$250,000 of their income.

00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:31.528
And families everywhere would
enjoy some peace of mind.

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:33.961
The Senate has already
done their part.

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:36.328
Now we're just waiting for
Republicans in the House to do

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:37.828
the same thing.

00:01:37.828 --> 00:01:41.428
But so far, they've put forward
an unbalanced plan that actually

00:01:41.428 --> 00:01:44.661
lowers rates for the
wealthiest Americans.

00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:46.961
If we want to protect
the middle class,

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:49.394
then the math just doesn't work.

00:01:49.394 --> 00:01:52.194
We can and should do more
than just extend middle

00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:53.428
class tax cuts.

00:01:53.428 --> 00:01:56.861
And I stand ready to work with
Republicans on a plan that spurs

00:01:56.861 --> 00:02:00.695
economic growth, creates jobs
and reduces our deficit --

00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:04.328
a plan that gives both sides
some of what they want.

00:02:04.328 --> 00:02:06.494
I'm willing to find ways to
bring down the cost of health

00:02:06.494 --> 00:02:08.961
care without hurting seniors
and other Americans who

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:10.361
depend on it.

00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:13.695
And I'm willing to make more
entitlement spending cuts on top

00:02:13.695 --> 00:02:16.795
of the $1 trillion dollars in
spending cuts I signed into

00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:18.828
law last year.

00:02:18.828 --> 00:02:21.428
But if we're serious about
reducing our deficit while still

00:02:21.428 --> 00:02:24.261
investing in things like
education and research that are

00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:26.561
important to growing
our economy --

00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:29.528
and if we're serious about
protecting middle-class families

00:02:29.528 --> 00:02:31.861
-- then we're also going to have
to ask the wealthiest Americans

00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:33.961
to pay higher tax rates.

00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:37.061
That's one principle I
won't compromise on.

00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:40.261
After all, this was a central
question in the election.

00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:43.895
A clear majority of Americans
-- Democrats, Republicans and

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:47.528
Independents -- agreed with
a balanced approach that asks

00:02:47.528 --> 00:02:50.428
something from everyone, but a
little more from those who can

00:02:50.428 --> 00:02:52.695
afford it the most.

00:02:52.695 --> 00:02:55.795
It's the only way to put our
economy on a sustainable path

00:02:55.795 --> 00:02:59.194
without asking even more
from the middle class.

00:02:59.194 --> 00:03:02.428
And it's the only kind of
plan I'm willing to sign.

00:03:02.428 --> 00:03:05.561
Everyone agrees we need to bring
down our deficit and strengthen

00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:07.961
our economy for the long-term.

00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:10.594
The question is whether we can
do it in a responsible way that

00:03:10.594 --> 00:03:13.161
allows us to keep investing in
the things that have always made

00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:14.895
America strong.

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:16.561
I'm convinced we can.

00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:18.961
And if both sides are
willing to compromise,

00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:22.661
I believe we can give businesses
and families a sense of security

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:24.728
going into the New Year.

00:03:24.728 --> 00:03:26.728
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
