00:00:08.728 --> 00:00:10.027
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.027 --> 00:00:13.094
Over the past few months, I've
laid out a series of commonsense

00:00:13.094 --> 00:00:16.795
ideas to reignite the true
engine of our economic growth:

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:19.828
a rising, thriving middle class.

00:00:19.828 --> 00:00:21.928
The way I see it, there
are three areas where we

00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:23.461
need to focus.

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:27.294
One: making America a
magnet for good jobs.

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:30.695
Two: making sure our workers have the education and skills

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:32.895
they need to do those jobs.

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:37.561
And three: making sure your hard work leads to a decent living.

00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:40.027
I've also been visiting cities
across the country that are

00:00:40.027 --> 00:00:41.695
doing some interesting
and creative things

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:42.861
along these lines.

00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:45.594
So on Friday, for example,
I stopped by a factory in

00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:48.795
Baltimore that's creating good jobs here at home by exporting

00:00:48.795 --> 00:00:50.895
dredging equipment abroad.

00:00:50.895 --> 00:00:53.194
I read with young kids
at a pre-K program,

00:00:53.194 --> 00:00:55.561
where kids are getting a head
start learning the skills

00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:57.561
they need to succeed in life.

00:00:57.561 --> 00:01:00.127
And I stopped by a program
that's helping folks in tough

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:03.328
circumstances -- especially
low-income dads --

00:01:03.328 --> 00:01:06.061
get the training and guidance
they need to find work and

00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:07.961
support their families.

00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:10.194
That's why I like getting out
of the Washington echo chamber

00:01:10.194 --> 00:01:12.194
whenever I can --
because too often,

00:01:12.194 --> 00:01:15.127
our politics aren't focused
on the same things you are.

00:01:15.127 --> 00:01:16.127
Working hard.

00:01:16.127 --> 00:01:19.394
Supporting your family and
supporting your community.

00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:23.127
Making sure your kids
have every chance in life.

00:01:23.127 --> 00:01:25.761
More than anything, the American
people make me optimistic about

00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:27.127
where we're headed as a nation.

00:01:27.127 --> 00:01:29.294
Especially after all we've
been through during the past

00:01:29.294 --> 00:01:30.961
several years.

00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:34.094
And that should encourage us
all to work even harder on the

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.261
issues that matter to you.

00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:38.828
In a little over three years,
our businesses have created more

00:01:38.828 --> 00:01:40.961
than 6.5 million new jobs.

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:43.094
And while our unemployment
rate is still too high,

00:01:43.094 --> 00:01:45.994
it's the lowest it's
been since 2008.

00:01:45.994 --> 00:01:49.628
But now we need to create even
more good, middle-class jobs,

00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:51.928
and we've got to do it faster.

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:54.994
Corporate profits have
skyrocketed to an all-time high.

00:01:54.994 --> 00:01:58.227
But now we need to get
middle-class wages and incomes

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:00.127
rising, too.

00:02:00.127 --> 00:02:01.328
Our housing market is healing.

00:02:01.328 --> 00:02:04.695
But we need to do a lot more
to help families stay in their

00:02:04.695 --> 00:02:07.428
homes, or to help them
refinance to take advantage of

00:02:07.428 --> 00:02:09.328
historically low rates.

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:12.061
And our deficits -- well,
they're shrinking at the fastest

00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:13.394
rate in decades.

00:02:13.394 --> 00:02:16.394
But now we've got to budget in
a smarter way that doesn't hurt

00:02:16.394 --> 00:02:19.728
middle-class families or
harm critical investments in

00:02:19.728 --> 00:02:21.328
our future.

00:02:21.328 --> 00:02:23.628
So in a lot of sectors,
things are looking up.

00:02:23.628 --> 00:02:25.628
The American auto
industry is thriving.

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:27.328
American energy is booming.

00:02:27.328 --> 00:02:30.494
And American ingenuity in
our high tech sector has the

00:02:30.494 --> 00:02:33.761
potential to change the way
we do almost everything.

00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:35.761
In the coming weeks, I'm going
to visit more cities like

00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:39.161
Baltimore, and Austin, Texas
-- where I was two weeks ago;

00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:41.761
places where Americans are
coming together to strengthen

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:44.828
their own communities and economies -- and in the process,

00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:47.528
making this country
better for all of us.

00:02:47.528 --> 00:02:50.194
And I'm going to keep trying
to work with both parties in

00:02:50.194 --> 00:02:54.127
Washington to make progress
on your priorities.

00:02:54.127 --> 00:02:56.394
Because I know that if we come
together around creating more

00:02:56.394 --> 00:02:58.861
jobs, educating
more of our kids,

00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:01.628
and building new ladders of
opportunity for everyone who's

00:03:01.628 --> 00:03:06.328
willing to climb them --
we'll all prosper, together.

00:03:06.328 --> 00:03:07.328
Thanks.

00:03:07.328 --> 00:03:08.328
And have a great weekend.
