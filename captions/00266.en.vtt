00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:08.467
The President:
Over the past two years, we've won a number of battles to

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:10.934
defend the interests of the
middle class.

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:12.900
One of the most important
victories we achieved was the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.433
passage of Wall Street Reform.

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:18.266
This was a bill designed to rein
in the secret deals and reckless

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.800
gambling that nearly brought
down the financial system.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.633
It set new rules so that
taxpayers would never again be

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:28.934
on the hook for a bailout if a
big financial company went under.

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:31.367
And reform included the
strongest consumer protections

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:35.233
in history to put an end to a
lot of the hidden fees,

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:38.767
deceptive mortgages, and other
abusive practices used to tilt

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:43.066
the table against ordinary
people in their financial dealings.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.867
It was a tough fight.

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:47.166
The special interests poured
millions into a lobbying

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:50.633
campaign to prevent us from
reforming the system --

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:52.834
a system that worked a lot
better for them than for middle

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:54.600
class families.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.367
Some in the financial industry
were eager to protect a status

00:00:57.367 --> 00:01:01.100
quo that basically allowed them
to play by their own rules --

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.300
and these interests held common
cause with Republican leaders in

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.934
Washington who were looking to
score a political victory in an

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:09.433
election year.

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:12.567
But their efforts failed, and we
succeeded in passing reform in

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:15.900
the hopes of ensuring that we
never again face a crisis like

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.200
the one we've been through -- a crisis that unleashed an

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.000
economic downturn as deep as any since the Great Depression.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.500
Even today, we're still digging
out of the damage it unleashed

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.934
on our economy.

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:30.100
Millions of people are still out
of work.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.800
Millions of families are still
hurting.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.834
We're also seeing the
reverberations of this crisis

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:38.834
with the rise in foreclosures,
and recently we've seen problems

00:01:38.834 --> 00:01:42.467
in foreclosure proceedings -- mistakes that have led to

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:44.967
disruptions in the housing markets.

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:47.667
This is only one more piece of
evidence as to why Wall Street

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:50.500
reform is so necessary.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.266
In fact, as part of reform, a
new consumer watchdog is now

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.734
standing up.

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:58.567
It will have just one job -- looking out for ordinary

00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:01.166
consumers in the financial system.

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.967
And this watchdog will have the
authority to guard against

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:08.667
unfair practices in mortgage
transactions and foreclosures.

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:10.900
Yet despite the importance of
this law,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.934
and despite the terrible
economic dislocation caused by

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:17.533
the failures in our financial
system under the old rules,

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.233
top Republicans in Congress are
now beating the drum to repeal

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:24.633
all of these reforms and
consumer protections.

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:27.533
Recently, one of the Republican
leaders in the Senate said that

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:30.467
if Republicans take charge of
Congress,

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:34.266
repeal would be one of the first
orders of business.

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:36.967
And he joins the top Republican
in the House,

00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:42.033
who actually called for the law
to be repealed even before it passed.

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:44.600
I think that would be a terrible
mistake.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.266
Our economy depends on a
financial system in which

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:50.433
everyone competes on a level
playing field and everyone is

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:53.734
held to the same rules -- whether you're a big bank,

00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:57.600
a small business owner, or a family looking to buy a house or

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.400
open a credit card.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.667
And as we saw, without sound
oversight and common sense

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:07.700
protections for consumers, the
whole economy is put in jeopardy.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.800
That doesn't serve Main Street,
that doesn't serve Wall Street;

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.467
that doesn't serve anyone.

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:15.333
And that's why I think it's so
important that we not take this

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:17.867
country backward -- that we don't go back to the broken

00:03:17.867 --> 00:03:19.767
system we had before.

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:21.934
We've got to keep moving
forward.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:22.967
Thanks.
