00:00:06.116 --> 00:00:08.846
We begin this year and this
Administration in the midst

00:00:08.846 --> 00:00:12.346
of an unprecedented crisis that
calls for unprecedented action.

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:16.406
Just this week, we saw more
people file for unemployment

00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:18.546
than at any time in the
last twenty-six years,

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.896
and experts agree that
if nothing is done,

00:00:21.256 --> 00:00:23.506
the unemployment rate
could reach double digits.

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:26.426
Our economy could
fall $1 trillion short

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:29.276
of its full capacity,
which translates into more

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:32.686
than $12,000 in lost
income for a family of four.

00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:35.546
And we could lose a
generation of potential,

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:39.216
as more young Americans are
forced to forgo college dreams

00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:41.466
or the chance to train for
the jobs of the future.

00:00:42.636 --> 00:00:45.596
In short, if we do not
act boldly and swiftly,

00:00:46.086 --> 00:00:48.526
a bad situation could
become dramatically worse.

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:52.026
That is why I have proposed
an American Recovery

00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:53.066
and Reinvestment Plan

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:56.406
to immediately jumpstart
job creation as well

00:00:56.406 --> 00:00:57.736
as long-term economic growth.

00:00:58.056 --> 00:01:00.316
I am pleased to say
that both parties

00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:02.676
in Congress are already
hard at work on this plan,

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:05.536
and I hope to sign it into
law in less than a month.

00:01:06.456 --> 00:01:08.536
It's a plan that will
save or create three

00:01:08.536 --> 00:01:10.906
to four million jobs
over the next few years,

00:01:11.326 --> 00:01:14.526
and one that recognizes both
the paradox and the promise

00:01:14.526 --> 00:01:16.996
of this moment - the fact
that there are millions

00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:20.786
of Americans trying to find work
even as, all around the country,

00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:22.306
there's so much work to be done.

00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:25.776
That's why this is not
just a short-term program

00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:26.616
to boost employment.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:30.276
It's one that will invest in
our most important priorities

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.796
like energy and education;
health care

00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:36.176
and a new infrastructure that
are necessary to keep us strong

00:01:36.176 --> 00:01:38.386
and competitive in
the 21st century.

00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:41.086
Today I'd like to
talk specifically

00:01:41.086 --> 00:01:43.926
about the progress we expect
to make in each of these areas.

00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:47.316
To accelerate the creation
of a clean energy economy,

00:01:47.676 --> 00:01:50.706
we will double our capacity to
generate alternative sources

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:53.476
of energy like wind,
solar, and biofuels

00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:54.796
over the next three years.

00:01:55.346 --> 00:01:58.266
We'll begin to build a new
electricity grid that lay

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:01.536
down more than 3,000 miles
of transmission lines

00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:04.696
to convey this new energy
from coast to coast.

00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:10.056
We'll save taxpayers $2
billion a year by making 75%

00:02:10.056 --> 00:02:12.246
of federal buildings
more energy efficient,

00:02:12.756 --> 00:02:15.736
and save the average
working family $350

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:19.626
on their energy bills by
weatherizing 2.5 million homes.

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:22.456
To lower health care
cost, cut medical errors,

00:02:22.456 --> 00:02:23.316
and improve care,

00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:26.506
we'll computerize the nation's
health record in five years,

00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:28.236
saving billions of dollars

00:02:28.236 --> 00:02:30.426
in health care costs
and countless lives.

00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:32.816
And we'll protect
health insurance for more

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:35.336
than 8 million Americans
who are in danger

00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:37.726
of losing their coverage
during this economic downturn.

00:02:38.916 --> 00:02:41.356
To ensure our children
can compete and succeed

00:02:41.356 --> 00:02:43.526
in this new economy,
we'll renovate

00:02:43.526 --> 00:02:45.716
and modernize 10,000 schools,

00:02:46.106 --> 00:02:48.396
building state-of-the-art
classrooms, libraries,

00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:51.836
and labs to improve learning
for over five million students.

00:02:52.516 --> 00:02:55.096
We'll invest more in Pell Grants
to make college affordable

00:02:55.096 --> 00:02:56.766
for seven million more students,

00:02:57.236 --> 00:03:02.076
provide a $2,500 college tax
credit to four million students,

00:03:02.476 --> 00:03:05.096
and triple the number of
fellowships in science

00:03:05.316 --> 00:03:07.506
to help spur the next
generation of innovation.

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:11.986
Finally, we will rebuild
and retrofit America

00:03:11.986 --> 00:03:13.916
to meet the demands
of the 21st century.

00:03:14.636 --> 00:03:17.156
That means repairing and
modernizing thousands of miles

00:03:17.156 --> 00:03:18.386
of America's roadways

00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:20.466
and providing new
mass transit options

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:21.776
for millions of Americans.

00:03:22.326 --> 00:03:25.966
It means protecting America
by securing 90 major ports

00:03:26.286 --> 00:03:28.196
and creating a better
communications network

00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:31.246
for local law enforcement
and public safety officials

00:03:31.246 --> 00:03:32.716
in the event of an emergency.

00:03:33.516 --> 00:03:36.856
And it means expanding broadband
access to millions of Americans,

00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:39.476
so business can compete
on a level-playing field,

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:40.996
wherever they're located.

00:03:41.476 --> 00:03:43.996
I know that some are skeptical
about the size and scale

00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:44.946
of this recovery plan.

00:03:45.646 --> 00:03:47.056
I understand that skepticism,

00:03:47.486 --> 00:03:49.786
which is why this
recovery plan must

00:03:49.786 --> 00:03:52.196
and will include
unprecedented measures

00:03:52.376 --> 00:03:53.776
that will allow the
American people

00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:56.786
to hold my Administration
accountable for these results.

00:03:57.406 --> 00:03:59.056
We won't just throw
money at our problems -

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:00.646
we'll invest in what works.

00:04:01.156 --> 00:04:03.466
Instead of politicians doling
out money behind a veil

00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:05.046
of secrecy, decisions

00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:08.116
about where we invest will
be made public, and informed

00:04:08.116 --> 00:04:10.486
by independent experts
whenever possible.

00:04:11.286 --> 00:04:13.866
We'll launch an unprecedented
effort to root out waste,

00:04:13.926 --> 00:04:16.556
inefficiency, and unnecessary
spending in our government,

00:04:17.176 --> 00:04:19.696
and every American
will be able to see how

00:04:19.696 --> 00:04:22.286
and where we spend
taxpayer dollars by going

00:04:22.286 --> 00:04:25.016
to a new website
called recovery.gov.

00:04:26.586 --> 00:04:29.556
No one policy or program will
solve the challenges we face

00:04:29.556 --> 00:04:31.996
right now, nor will
this crisis recede

00:04:31.996 --> 00:04:33.186
in a short period of time.

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:35.916
But if we act now
and act boldly;

00:04:36.346 --> 00:04:39.776
if we start rewarding hard work
and responsibility once more;

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:42.946
if we act as citizens
and not partisans

00:04:43.236 --> 00:04:45.716
and begin again the work
of remaking America,

00:04:46.316 --> 00:04:48.016
then I have faith
that we will emerge

00:04:48.106 --> 00:04:50.356
from this trying
time even stronger

00:04:50.626 --> 00:04:52.746
and more prosperous
than we were before.

00:04:53.706 --> 00:04:54.446
Thanks for listening.
