00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:09.266
President Obama:
Hello from the Country Corner
Farm in Alpha, Illinois.

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.500
For the past few days, I've been
traveling to small towns and

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.834
farm towns here in the
heartland of this country.

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:18.233
I sat down with small business
owners in Guttenberg, Iowa,

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:21.000
and ranchers and
farmers in Peosta.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.834
I had lunch with veterans
in Cannon Falls, Minnesota,

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:26.400
and talked to plant workers
at a seed distributor in

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.433
Atkinson, Illinois.

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:31.467
And to the girls volleyball
team and Maquoketa High School,

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:35.300
let me just say one
thing -- go Cardinals!

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.467
Now, I'm out here
for one reason --

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:39.800
I think Washington, D.C. can
learn something from the folks

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.800
in Atkinson and Peosta
and Cannon Falls.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.667
I think our country would be
a whole lot better off if our

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:51.066
elected leaders showed the same
kind of discipline and integrity

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:54.233
and responsibility that most
Americans demonstrate in their

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:56.967
lives every single day.

00:00:56.967 --> 00:01:00.367
Because the fact is, we're going
through a tough time right now.

00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:02.400
We're coming through a
terrible recession --

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.800
a lot of folks are
still looking for work.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.800
A lot of people are getting by
with smaller paychecks or less

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.900
money in the cash register.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.700
So we need folks
in Washington --

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.467
the people whose job it is
to deal with the country's

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:16.633
problems, the people who
you elected to serve --

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:21.000
we need them to put aside their
differences to get things done.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.567
There are things we can do
right now that will mean more

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:27.233
customers for businesses and
more jobs across the country.

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:30.367
We can cut payroll taxes again
so families have an extra

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:32.367
thousand dollars to spend.

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:35.800
We can pass a road construction
bill so construction crews who

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.600
are now sitting idle can
head back to the work site,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.166
rebuilding roads and
bridges and airports.

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.166
We've got brave,
skilled Americans,

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.967
returning from Iraq
and Afghanistan.

00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:47.500
Let's connect them with
businesses that could

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.333
use their skills.

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:52.200
And let's pass trade deals to
level the playing field for

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.000
our businesses.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.567
We have Americans driving
Hyundais and Kias --

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:59.033
well, I want to see folks
in Korea driving Fords,

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:01.533
Chevys and Chryslers.

00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:04.533
I want more products sold around
the globe stamped with three

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:07.233
words -- "Made in America."

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:10.166
These are commonsense ideas --
ideas that have been supported

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:12.934
by both Democrats
and Republicans.

00:02:12.934 --> 00:02:15.967
The only thing holding
them back is politics.

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:18.100
The only thing preventing us
from passing these bills is the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.133
refusal by some in Congress to
put country ahead of party.

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:24.000
That's the problem
we have right now.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.867
That's what's holding
this country back.

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:28.767
That's what we have to change.

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:31.233
Because for all the
knocks we've taken,

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:33.567
despite all the
challenges we face,

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:36.400
this is still the greatest
country on Earth.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.567
We still have the best
workers and farmers,

00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:43.033
entrepreneurs and businesses,
students and scientists.

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:45.000
And you can see
that here in Alpha.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.300
You can see it along the country
roads that connect these small

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.767
towns and farmlands.

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:50.900
You know, these
that past few days,

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.567
I've been seeing little
kids with American flags,

00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:56.233
and grandparents in lawn chairs.

00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:58.533
I've shaken hands with folks
outside machine shops and

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:01.667
churches, corner
stores and farms.

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:05.000
It reminds me of why I
got into public service in

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.700
the first place.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.066
Getting out of Washington and
spending time with the people of

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:12.066
this country, seeing
how hard you're working,

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:15.033
how creative you are,
how resourceful you are,

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:18.600
how determined you are -- that
only makes me more determined to

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.266
serve you as best
I can as President.

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:24.433
And it only makes me more
confident in our future.

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:27.367
That's why it's so important
that folks in Washington put

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:29.233
country before party.

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:31.367
That's why it's so important
that our elected leaders get

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:34.633
past their differences to help
grow the economy and put this

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:36.867
nation back to work.

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:40.066
Because here in Alpha, it
couldn't be more clear --

00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:43.467
if we can come together, there
is no stopping the United States

00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:45.100
of America.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.066
There is no doubt that
our future is bright.

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:50.633
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
