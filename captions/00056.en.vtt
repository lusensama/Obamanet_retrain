The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.814
Sunday is International
Women's Day -- a day

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:18.385
to celebrate remarkable
women and girls worldwide,

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:21.020
and to re-dedicate
ourselves to defending

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.791
the fundamental rights and
dignity of all people.

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.793
That's why, this week,
Michelle and I launched

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.795
a new initiative on a
topic that's close

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:32.465
to both our hearts:
girls' education.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.968
It's called "Let
Girls Learn."

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.970
And its goal is to help
more girls around

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.974
the world go to school
and stay in school.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:45.078
Right now, 62 million girls who
should be in school, are not.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.914
And that's not an accident.

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:50.884
It's the direct result of
barriers, large and small,

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:55.121
that stand in the way of
girls who want to learn.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.991
Maybe their families can't
afford the school fees.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:01.795
Maybe the risk of being hurt
or kidnapped or even killed

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:05.031
by men who will do anything
to stop girls from learning

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:06.966
is just too great.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.968
Or maybe they aren't in
school because they're

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.970
expected to get married
and become mothers while

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.973
they're still teenagers
-- or even earlier.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.376
In too many parts of the
world, girls are still

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:19.946
valued more for their bodies
than for their minds.

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:21.648
That's just plain wrong.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.884
And we all have to
do more to stop it.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:28.188
That's the idea behind
"Let Girls Learn."

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.457
We're making it clear to any
country that's our partner --

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:34.127
or that wants to be our partner
-- that they need to get

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:38.198
serious about increasing the
number of girls in school.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.333
Our diplomats and
development experts are

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.368
already hard at work.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.537
Our Peace Corps volunteers
will play a big role, too.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:48.007
And we're putting our
partnerships with NGOs,

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.844
businesses and foundations
to work on behalf

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.912
of girls everywhere.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:55.315
I come to this issue as the
leader of the world's largest

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:57.250
economy, and
Commander-in-Chief

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.020
of the world's most powerful
military, and I'm convinced

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.189
that a world in which
girls are educated

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.694
is a safer, more stable,
more prosperous place.

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:09.696
When girls are
educated, their future

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:12.465
children are healthier
and better nourished.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:15.535
Their future wages increase,
which in turn strengthens

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.637
their families' security.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:20.273
National growth
gets a boost, too.

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:22.842
And places where women and
girls are treated as full

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:25.945
and equal citizens
tend to be more stable

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:27.080
and more democratic.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.817
But I also come to this
issue as the father

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.219
of two wonderful
young women.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.688
And I know that there are
lots of girls just like Malia

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.791
and Sasha out there -- girls
who are funny and caring

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:41.494
and inquisitive and
strong, and have so much

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:43.730
to offer the world.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.033
It's a privilege to be
the parent of girls.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:49.702
And we want to make sure that
no girl out there is denied

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.572
her chance to learn -- that
no girl is prevented from

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:55.875
making her unique
contributions to the world.

00:02:55.875 --> 00:03:00.246
Because every girl -- every
girl -- deserves our respect.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:04.450
And every girl
deserves an education.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.352
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
