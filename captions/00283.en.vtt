00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:08.300
The President:
This weekend, I'm traveling to Toronto to meet the members of

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.867
the G20.

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:12.433
There, I hope we can build on
the progress we made at last

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:15.300
year's G20 summits by
coordinating our global

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.433
financial reform efforts to make
sure a crisis like the one from

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:21.967
which we are still recovering
never happens again.

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:23.934
We've made great progress towards passing such a reform

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:25.400
here at home.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.133
As I speak, we are on the
cusp of enacting the toughest

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:31.734
financial reforms since
the Great Depression.

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:34.667
I don't have to tell you why
these reforms are so important.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:37.133
We're still digging ourselves
out of an economic crisis that

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:40.333
happened largely because there
wasn't strong enough oversight

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.967
on Wall Street.

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:45.567
We can't build a strong economy
in America over the long-run

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:49.200
without ending this status quo,
and laying a new foundation for

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.233
growth and prosperity.

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:53.567
That's what the Wall Street
reforms currently making their

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:55.800
way through Congress
will help us do --

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.400
reforms that represent 90% of
what I proposed when I took up this fight.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.967
We'll put in place the strongest
consumer financial protections

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:06.567
in American history, and create
an independent agency with an

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:10.700
independent director and an
independent budget to enforce them.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.000
Credit card companies will no
longer be able to mislead you

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.533
with pages and
pages of fine print.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.033
You will no longer be subject
to all kinds of hidden fees and

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:22.633
penalties, or the predatory
practices of unscrupulous lenders.

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:24.967
Instead, we'll make sure credit
card companies and mortgage

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:27.133
companies play by the rules.

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:30.166
And you'll be empowered with
easy-to-understand forms,

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:33.100
and the clear and concise
information you need to make the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.900
financial decisions that are
best for you and your family.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.266
Wall Street reform will also
strengthen our economy in a

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.967
number of other ways.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:43.867
We'll make our financial system
more transparent by bringing the

00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:47.000
kinds of complex trades that
helped trigger this crisis --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.133
trades in a $600 trillion
derivatives market --

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.266
finally into the light of day.

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:56.333
We'll enact what's called the
Volcker Rule to make sure banks

00:01:56.333 --> 00:02:00.867
protected by safety nets like
the FDIC can't engage in risky

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:02.967
trades for their own profit.

00:02:02.967 --> 00:02:05.100
We'll create what's called a
resolution authority to help

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.834
wind down firms whose collapse
would threaten our entire

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:09.600
financial system.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.166
Put simply, we'll end the days
of taxpayer-funded bailouts,

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:16.734
and help make sure Main Street
is never again held responsible

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:18.834
for Wall Street's mistakes.

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:21.700
Beyond these reforms, we also
need to address another piece of

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.333
unfinished business.

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:25.467
We need to impose a fee on the
banks that were the biggest

00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:28.066
beneficiaries of taxpayer
assistance at the height of our

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:33.367
financial crisis -- so we can recover every dime of taxpayer money.

00:02:33.367 --> 00:02:36.533
Getting this far on Wall Street
reform hasn't been easy.

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:38.800
There are those who've fought it
tooth and nail to preserve the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.333
status quo.

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:43.133
In recent months, they've spent
millions of dollars and hired an

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:46.667
army of lobbyists to stop
reform dead in its tracks.

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:50.367
But because we refused to
back down, and kept fighting,

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:52.467
we now stand on the
verge of victory.

00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:55.333
And I urge Congress to take
us over the finish line,

00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:58.233
and send me a reform
bill I can sign into law,

00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:01.367
so we can empower our people
with consumer protections,

00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:04.600
and help prevent a financial
crisis like this from ever

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.367
happening again.
