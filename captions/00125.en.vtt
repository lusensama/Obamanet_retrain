00:00:05.758 --> 00:00:07.258
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.258 --> 00:00:10.358
This Tuesday is an important
day for families, businesses,

00:00:10.358 --> 00:00:12.024
and our economy.

00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:15.625
It's the day a big part of the
Affordable Care Act kicks in,

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:17.124
and tens of millions
of Americans

00:00:17.124 --> 00:00:19.425
will finally have
the same chance to buy

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:23.224
quality, affordable health care
as everyone else.

00:00:23.224 --> 00:00:24.425
It's also the day that a group

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:26.158
of far-right
Republicans in Congress

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:28.358
might choose to
shut down the government

00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:30.124
and potentially
damage the economy

00:00:30.124 --> 00:00:33.124
just because they
don't like this law.

00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:34.325
I'll get to that in a second.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:37.224
But first - here's what
the Affordable Care Act

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:38.892
means for you.

00:00:38.892 --> 00:00:40.958
If you're one of the vast
majority of Americans

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.991
who already have health care,

00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:45.658
you already have new benefits 
you didn't before,

00:00:45.658 --> 00:00:46.858
like free mammograms

00:00:46.858 --> 00:00:49.224
and contraceptive
care with no copay,

00:00:49.224 --> 00:00:52.625
and discounts on prescription 
medicine for seniors.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:54.758
You've already got new
protections in place too,

00:00:54.758 --> 00:00:57.224
like no more lifetime
limits on your care,

00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:58.925
no more discriminating
against children

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:00.625
with preexisting
conditions like asthma,

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.625
or being able to stay
on your parents' plan

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:06.091
until you turn 26.

00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:07.858
That's all
in place and available

00:01:07.858 --> 00:01:10.758
to Americans with 
health insurance right now.

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:12.658
If you don't have
health insurance,

00:01:12.658 --> 00:01:14.692
or if you buy it on
the individual market,

00:01:14.692 --> 00:01:17.191
then starting this
Tuesday, October 1st,

00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:19.191
you can visit HealthCare.gov

00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:22.091
to find what's called
the health insurance marketplace

00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:23.925
in your state.

00:01:23.925 --> 00:01:25.258
This is a website where you can

00:01:25.258 --> 00:01:28.024
compare insurance
plans, side-by-side,

00:01:28.024 --> 00:01:31.191
the same way you'd shop
for a TV or a plane ticket.

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:34.058
You'll see new choices
and new competition.

00:01:34.058 --> 00:01:36.425
Many of you will
see cheaper prices,

00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:39.158
and many of you will
be eligible for tax credits

00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:41.991
that bring down
your costs even more.

00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:44.991
Nearly 6 in 10 uninsured
Americans will be able

00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:49.558
to get coverage
for $100 or less.

00:01:49.558 --> 00:01:51.591
If you're one
of the up to half of Americans

00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:53.325
with a preexisting condition,

00:01:53.325 --> 00:01:55.325
these new plans mean
your insurer can no longer

00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:57.558
charge you more
than anyone else.

00:01:57.558 --> 00:02:01.291
They can't charge women more
than men for the same coverage.

00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:04.525
And they take
effect January 1st.

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:07.024
So get covered
at HealthCare.gov.

00:02:07.024 --> 00:02:08.591
And spread the word.

00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:11.358
These marketplaces will be
open for business on Tuesday,

00:02:11.358 --> 00:02:12.825
no matter what.

00:02:12.825 --> 00:02:15.058
The Affordable Care Act is one
of the most important things

00:02:15.058 --> 00:02:17.058
we've done as
a country in decades

00:02:17.058 --> 00:02:19.858
to strengthen economic security 
for the middle class

00:02:19.858 --> 00:02:21.792
and all who strive
to join the middle class.

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:23.925
And it is going to work.

00:02:23.925 --> 00:02:26.058
That's also one of the reasons
it's so disturbing

00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:28.658
that Republicans
in Congress are threatening

00:02:28.658 --> 00:02:30.825
to shut down the government -
or worse -

00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:33.591
if I don't agree
to gut this law.

00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:36.024
Congress has two
responsibilities right now:

00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:39.792
pass a budget on time,
and pay our bills on time.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:42.692
If Congress doesn't
pass a budget by Monday -

00:02:42.692 --> 00:02:44.258
the end of the fiscal year -

00:02:44.258 --> 00:02:45.658
the government shuts down,

00:02:45.658 --> 00:02:49.258
along with many vital services
the American people depend on.

00:02:49.258 --> 00:02:51.058
On Friday,
the Senate passed a bill

00:02:51.058 --> 00:02:53.158
to keep the government open.

00:02:53.158 --> 00:02:55.725
But Republicans in the House
have been more concerned with

00:02:55.725 --> 00:02:59.058
appeasing an extreme faction of
their party than working to pass

00:02:59.058 --> 00:03:02.191
a budget that creates new jobs
or strengthens the middle class.

00:03:02.191 --> 00:03:03.958
And in the next couple days,

00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.725
these Republicans
will have to decide

00:03:05.725 --> 00:03:08.792
whether to join the Senate
and keep the government open,

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:10.692
or create a crisis
that will hurt people

00:03:10.692 --> 00:03:12.792
for the sole
purpose of advancing

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:15.258
their ideological agenda.

00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:18.224
Past government shutdowns
have disrupted the economy.

00:03:18.224 --> 00:03:20.091
This shutdown would, too.

00:03:20.091 --> 00:03:23.191
At a moment when our economy
has steadily gained traction,

00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:25.058
and our deficits
have been falling faster

00:03:25.058 --> 00:03:27.758
than at any time in 60 years,

00:03:27.758 --> 00:03:31.391
a shutdown would be
a purely self-inflicted wound.

00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:33.391
And that's why many
Republican Senators

00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:34.858
and Republican governors

00:03:34.858 --> 00:03:37.758
have urged Republicans
in the House of Representatives

00:03:37.758 --> 00:03:41.792
to knock it off,
pass a budget, and move on.

00:03:41.792 --> 00:03:45.892
This brings me to the second
responsibility Congress has.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.458
Once they vote to keep
the government open,

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:50.692
they must also vote
within the next couple weeks

00:03:50.692 --> 00:03:52.792
to allow the Treasury
to pay the bills

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:56.158
for the money that
Congress has already spent.

00:03:56.158 --> 00:03:57.625
Failure to meet
this responsibility

00:03:57.625 --> 00:04:00.725
would be far more dangerous
than a government shutdown -

00:04:00.725 --> 00:04:02.758
it would be
an economic shutdown,

00:04:02.758 --> 00:04:05.792
with impacts not just here,
but around the world.

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:07.991
Unfortunately some
Republicans have suggested that

00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:11.258
unless I agree to an even
longer list of demands -

00:04:11.258 --> 00:04:12.591
not just gutting the
health care law,

00:04:12.591 --> 00:04:15.458
but things like cutting
taxes for millionaires

00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:18.491
or rolling back rules on
big banks and polluters -

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.892
they'll push the button,

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:23.558
throwing America into default
for the first time in history

00:04:23.558 --> 00:04:26.558
and risk throwing us
back into recession.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.491
I will work with anyone
who wants to have

00:04:28.491 --> 00:04:31.591
a serious conservation
about our economic future.

00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:35.124
But I will not negotiate over
Congress' responsibility

00:04:35.124 --> 00:04:37.991
to pay the bills it
has already racked up.

00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:40.758
I don't know how to be
more clear about this:

00:04:40.758 --> 00:04:43.158
no one gets to threaten
the full faith and credit

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.058
of the United States of America

00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:48.224
just to extract
ideological concessions.

00:04:48.224 --> 00:04:51.525
No one gets to hurt our economy
and millions of innocent people

00:04:51.525 --> 00:04:55.325
just because there are a
couple laws you don't like.

00:04:55.325 --> 00:04:56.658
It hasn't been done in the past,

00:04:56.658 --> 00:04:59.558
and we're not going to
start doing it now.

00:04:59.558 --> 00:05:03.325
The American people have worked
too hard to recover from crisis

00:05:03.325 --> 00:05:06.058
to see extremists in their
Congress cause another one.

00:05:06.058 --> 00:05:09.792
And every day this goes on
is another day that we can't

00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:13.425
continue the work of rebuilding
the great American middle class.

00:05:13.425 --> 00:05:18.158
Congress needs to pass a budget
in time, pay its bills on time,

00:05:18.158 --> 00:05:20.591
and refocus on the
everyday concerns

00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:22.758
of the people who
sent them there.

00:05:22.758 --> 00:05:24.425
That's what I'm focused on.

00:05:24.425 --> 00:05:26.391
That's what I'll
keep fighting for.

00:05:26.391 --> 00:05:27.925
Thanks so much.
