00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:11.845
The President: As
Commander in Chief,

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.347
my highest priority is the
security of the American people.

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:17.684
And I've made it clear that
those who threaten the United

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.453
States will find no safe haven.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:23.390
Thanks to our military and
counterterrorism professionals,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.593
we took out Osama bin Laden,
much of al Qaeda's leadership

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:29.963
in Afghanistan and Pakistan,
and leaders of al Qaeda

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:32.766
affiliates in Yemen
and Somalia.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.135
We've prevented
terrorist attacks,

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:39.706
saved American lives and made
our homeland more secure.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.708
Today, the terrorist
threat is more diffuse,

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.178
from al Qaeda affiliates and
other extremists-like ISIL

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:47.514
in Syria and Iraq.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:49.716
As I said this week, our
intelligence community has

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:53.386
not yet detected specific ISIL
plots against our homeland.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:57.123
But its leaders have repeatedly
threatened the United States.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:01:00.493
And, if left unchecked, these
terrorists could pose a growing

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:04.798
threat beyond the Middle East,
including to the United States.

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:06.299
So we're staying vigilant.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.835
And we're moving ahead with
our strategy to degrade

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:12.505
and ultimately destroy this
terrorist organization.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:15.208
To meet a threat like
this, we have to be smart.

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.210
We have to use our power wisely.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.313
And we have to avoid the
mistakes of the past.

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:22.482
American military
power is unmatched,

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.185
but this can't be
America's fight alone.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:28.655
And the best way to defeat a
group like ISIL isn't by sending

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.225
large numbers of American combat
forces to wage a ground war

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.093
in the heart of the Middle East.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:36.229
That wouldn't serve
our interests.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.667
In fact, it would only risk
fueling extremism even more.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.870
What's needed now is a targeted,
relentless counterterrorism

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.407
campaign against ISIL that
combines American air power,

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:49.776
contributions from
allies and partners,

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.345
and more support to forces
that are fighting these

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.379
terrorists on the ground.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:56.416
And that's exactly
what we're doing.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.585
We're moving ahead with our
campaign of airstrikes against

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:01.254
these terrorists, and we're
prepared to take action

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:03.990
against ISIL in Syria as well.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.359
The additional American forces
I've ordered to Iraq will

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.496
help Iraqi and Kurdish
forces with the training,

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:13.032
intelligence and equipment
they need to take the fight

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:15.134
to these terrorists
on the ground.

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:17.670
We're working with Congress to
expand our efforts to train

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.039
and equip the Syrian opposition.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.243
We'll continue to strengthen
our defenses here at home.

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:25.945
And we'll keep providing the
humanitarian relief to help

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:28.381
Iraqi civilians who have
been driven from their

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:32.318
homes and who remain in
extreme danger.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.787
Because we're leading
the right way,

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.557
more nations are
joining our coalition.

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:40.059
This week, Arab nations agreed
to strengthen their support

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.196
for the new Iraqi government and
to do their part in the fight

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:47.100
against ISIL, including aspects
of the military campaign.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.202
Saudi Arabia will join
the effort to help train

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:52.438
and equip moderate Syrian
opposition forces.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:55.875
And retired Marine general John
Allen-who during the Iraq war

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:58.578
worked with Sunnis in Iraq as
they fought to reclaim their

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:01.948
communities from terrorists-will
serve as our special envoy

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:05.985
to help build and coordinate
our growing coalition.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.721
Today, every American can be
proud of our men and women

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.524
in uniform who are
serving in this effort.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:14.360
When our airstrikes helped break
the siege of the Iraqi town

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.664
of Amerl, one Kurdish fighter
on the ground said,

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:20.533
"It would have been
absolutely impossible

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:22.535
without the American planes."

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:27.140
One resident of that city
said-"thank you, America."

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.476
Today we're showing the world
the best of American leadership.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.045
We will protect our people.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.714
We will stand with partners
who defend their countries

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:38.051
and rally other nations to
meet a common threat.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.421
And here at home-thirteen
years after our country was

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:44.991
attacked-we continue to
stand tall and proud.

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:46.225
Because we're Americans.

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:48.328
We don't give in to fear.

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:49.329
We carry on.

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.599
And we will never waver in the
defense of the country we love.
