00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.834
The President:
Back in January, in my State of the Union Address,

00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:12.333
I warned of the danger posed by
a Supreme Court ruling called

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.367
Citizens United.

00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:18.433
This decision overturned
decades of law and precedent.

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:22.133
It gave the special interests
the power to spend without limit

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.934
-- and without public disclosure --

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:27.133
to run ads in order to influence elections.

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:31.400
Now, as an election approaches,
it's not just a theory.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.367
We can see for ourselves how
destructive to our democracy

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.266
this can become.

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.266
We've seen it in the flood of
deceptive attack ads sponsored

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:43.800
by special interests using front
groups with misleading names.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.266
We don't know who's behind these
ads or who's paying for them.

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.467
Even foreign-controlled
corporations seeking to

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:53.133
influence our democracy are able
to spend freely in order to

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:56.734
swing an election toward
a candidate they prefer.

00:00:56.734 --> 00:00:59.166
We've tried to fix
this with a new law --

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.700
one that would simply require
that you say who you are and

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.900
who's paying for your ad.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.533
This way, voters are able to
make an informed judgment about

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.500
a group's motivations.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.834
Anyone running these ads would
have to stand by their claims.

00:01:12.834 --> 00:01:15.233
And foreign-controlled
corporations would be restricted

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:17.734
from spending money to
influence elections,

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:21.967
just as they were before the
Supreme Court opened up this loophole.

00:01:21.967 --> 00:01:23.867
This is common sense.

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:26.867
In fact, this is the kind of
proposal that Democrats and

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:29.967
Republicans have
agreed on for decades.

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:34.066
Yet, the Republican leaders in
Congress have so far said "no."

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:37.633
They've blocked this bill from
even coming up for a vote in the Senate.

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:39.734
It's politics at its worst.

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:42.033
But it's not hard
to understand why.

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:45.400
Over the past two years, we've fought back against the

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.400
entrenched special interests -- weakening their hold on the

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.633
levers of power in Washington.

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:52.667
We've taken a stand against
the worst abuses of the

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:55.600
financial industry and the
health insurance companies.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.300
We've rolled back tax breaks
for companies that ship jobs overseas.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.567
And we've restored enforcement
of common sense rules to protect

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:05.133
clean air and clean water.

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:09.100
In other words, we've refused to go along with business as usual.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.967
Now, the special interests
want to take Congress back,

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:14.867
and return to the days when
lobbyists wrote the laws.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.533
And a partisan minority in
Congress is hoping their defense

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:20.800
of these special interests and
the status quo will be rewarded

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.367
with a flood of negative ads
against their opponents.

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:26.834
It's a power grab,
pure and simple.

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:29.367
They're hoping they can ride
this wave of unchecked influence

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:31.633
all the way to victory.

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:35.867
What's clear is that Congress
has a responsibility to act.

00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:38.834
But the truth is, any law will
probably come too late to

00:02:38.834 --> 00:02:42.734
prevent the damage that's already been done this election season.

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:46.033
And that's why, any time you see
an attack ad by one of these

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:48.967
shadowy groups, you
should ask yourself,

00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:51.300
who is paying for this ad?

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.166
Is it the health
insurance lobby?

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:54.734
The oil industry?

00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:57.200
The credit card companies?

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.200
More than that, you can make sure that the tens of millions

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.066
of dollars spent on misleading
ads don't drown out your voice.

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:07.367
Because no matter how
many ads they run --

00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:10.433
no matter how many elections
they try to buy --

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:14.967
the power to determine the fate
of this country doesn't lie in their hands.

00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:16.867
It lies in yours.

00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:20.433
It's up to all of us to defend
that most basic American

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:25.700
principle of a government
of, by, and for the people.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.000
What's at stake is
not just an election.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.333
It's our democracy itself.

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:31.433
Thanks.
