00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.240
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:15.648
In 1620, a small band
of pilgrims came to this

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.852
continent, refugees who
had fled persecution

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.621
and violence in their
native land.

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:24.891
Nearly 400 years later, we
remember their part in the

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:27.727
American story -- and we
honor the men and women who

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:30.563
helped them in
their time of need.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.400
Thanksgiving is a day
for food and football,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.236
and for hoping the turkey
didn't turn out too dry.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:38.505
But it's also a day to count
our blessings and give back

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:42.475
to others -- a reminder that
no matter our circumstances,

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:45.845
all of us have something
to be grateful for.

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:49.315
Maybe it's good health, a
new addition to the family,

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:53.586
or a child taking a next
step toward college or a career.

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:57.357
Maybe it's a new job,
or long overdue raise.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.826
Maybe it's something as
simple, and as important,

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:04.264
as the chance to spend time
with the people who matter most.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.800
Of course, every American
can be thankful for the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.369
chance to live in a country
founded on the belief that

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.738
all of us are created equal.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.973
And as President, I'm
thankful that I get to see

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:17.043
the best of America every
day -- the courage of our

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:20.079
troops and veterans, the
resilience of our families,

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.016
and the basic goodness of
the ordinary people

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.050
who call this country.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.788
On this uniquely
American holiday,

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:31.391
we also remember that so
much of our greatness comes

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:33.626
from our generosity.

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.728
There's the generosity of
Americans who volunteer at

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:38.398
food banks and shelters,
making sure that no one goes

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:41.534
hungry on a day when so
many plates are full.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.270
There's the generosity of
Americans who take part not

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.573
just in Black Friday
and Cyber Monday,

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:49.976
but Giving Tuesday --
recognizing that in the

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:52.078
holiday season, what you
give is as important

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.147
as what you get.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.983
And I've been touched by the
generosity of the Americans

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.853
who've written me letters
and emails in recent weeks,

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:03.223
offering to open their homes
to refugees fleeing

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:05.191
the brutality of ISIL.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.994
Now, people should remember
that no refugee can enter

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.797
our borders until they
undergo the highest security

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:14.634
checks of anyone traveling
to the United States.

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.536
That was the case
before Paris,

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:17.537
and it's the case now.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:21.975
And what happened in Paris
hasn't stopped Americans

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.544
from opening
their arms anyway.

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:27.580
One woman from Pennsylvania
wrote me to say,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.183
"Money is tight for us in my
household ...

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.684
But i have a guest room.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:33.720
I have a pantry
full of food.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.123
We can do this." Another
woman from Florida told me

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:40.193
her family's history dates
back to the Mayflower -- and

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:43.229
she said that welcoming
others is part of "what it

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.431
means to be an American."

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:48.434
Nearly four centuries after
the Mayflower set sail,

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:51.337
the world is still full of
pilgrims -- men and women

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.640
who want nothing more than
the chance for a safer,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.109
better future for themselves
and their families.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.648
What makes America America
is that we offer that chance.

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:04.484
We turn Lady Liberty's
light to the world,

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.153
and widen our circle of
concern to say that all

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:10.924
God's children are worthy
of our compassion and care.

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:12.926
That's part of what makes
this the greatest country

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:14.627
on Earth.

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.629
I hope that you and your
family have wonderful

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.265
Thanksgiving, surrounded
by loved ones,

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.334
and full of joy
and gratitude.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:25.405
And together, may we all
play our own small part in

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:27.941
the American story, and
write a next chapter that

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:32.245
future generations
can be thankful for.

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:34.380
From the Obama
family to yours,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.416
have a great Thanksgiving.
