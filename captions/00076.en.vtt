00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.511
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.481
I'm at Millennium Steel
in Princeton, Indiana,

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:18.318
to have a town hall with workers
on National Manufacturing Day.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.320
Because in many
ways, manufacturing

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.089
is the quintessential
middle-class job.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.091
And after a decade
of losing jobs,

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:28.194
American manufacturing is
once again adding them -

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:32.031
more than 700,000 over the
past four and a half years.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:34.134
In fact, it's been a bright
spot as we keep fighting

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:36.369
to recover from the
great recession.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:41.174
Last month, our businesses
added 236,000 new jobs.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:44.077
The unemployment rate fell
to under six percent for

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.646
the first time in more
than six years.

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:49.416
Over the past 55 months, our
businesses have added

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.085
10.3 million new jobs.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.087
That's the longest
uninterrupted stretch

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:57.357
of private sector job
creation in our history.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:00.360
And we're on pace to make
2014 the strongest year

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.700
of job growth since
the 1990s.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.100
This progress has been hard,
but it has been steady,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.101
and it is real.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.703
It is a direct result of the
American people's drive

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:14.974
and determination, and decisions
made by my administration.

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:17.677
During the last decade, people
thought the decline in American

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:20.046
manufacturing was inevitable.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:23.516
But we chose to invest in
American auto industry

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.251
and American workers.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:28.121
And today, an auto industry that
was flatlining six years ago

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.989
is building and selling
new cars at the fastest

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.658
pace in eight years.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:34.360
American manufacturing is
growing almost twice as fast

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.063
as the rest of the economy,
with new factories opening

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.966
their doors at the fastest
pace in decades.

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.001
That's progress we
can be proud of.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.838
What's also true is that too
many families still work

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:48.441
too many hours with too
little to show for it.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:51.244
And the much longer and profound
erosion of middle-class jobs

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:53.246
and incomes isn't
something we're going

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:54.747
to reverse overnight.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:57.917
But there are ideas we should
be putting into place that

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:00.553
would grow jobs and
wages faster right now.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:04.457
And one of the best would be
to raise the minimum wage.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.559
We've actually begun to see
some modest wage growth

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:08.094
in recent months.

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:11.464
But most folks still haven't
seen a raise in over a decade.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.466
It's time to stop
punishing some

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.468
of the hardest-working
Americans.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:17.470
It's time to raise
the minimum wage.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.472
It would put more money
in workers' pockets.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.774
It would help 28
million Americans.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:24.043
Recent surveys show that a
majority of small business

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.846
owners support a gradual
increase to ten dollars

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.615
and ten cents an hour.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.650
The folks who keep blocking
a minimum wage increase

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.585
are running out of excuses.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.854
Let's give America a raise.

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:37.390
Let's do this - because it would
make our economy stronger,

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.926
and make sure that
growth is shared.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:42.462
Rather than just reading about
our recovery in a headline,

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:45.031
more people will feel
it in their own lives.

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.734
And that's when
America does best.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:50.003
We do better when the
middle class does better,

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.472
and when more Americans
have their way to climb

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:53.940
into the middle class.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.609
And that's what drives
me every single day.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.211
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
