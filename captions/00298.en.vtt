00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.233
The President:
Last week, I spoke to you about
my commitment to work with

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:12.767
Congress to pass health
care reform this year.

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.567
Today, I'd like to speak about
how that effort is essential to

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:18.467
restoring fiscal responsibility.

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:20.233
When it comes to the
cost of health care,

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:23.767
this much is clear: the status
quo is unsustainable for

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:27.066
families, businesses,
and government.

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:31.000
America spends nearly 50 percent
more per person on health care

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.867
than any other country.

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:35.834
Health care premiums have
doubled over the last decade,

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:39.133
deductibles and out-of-pocket
costs have skyrocketed,

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:42.734
and many with preexisting
conditions are denied coverage.

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:45.100
More and more, Americans
are being priced out of the

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.100
care they need.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.033
These costs are also
hurting business,

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:52.000
as some big businesses are at a
competitive disadvantage with

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.233
their foreign counterparts, and
some small businesses are forced

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:59.533
to cut benefits, drop coverage,
or even lay off workers.

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.567
Meanwhile, Medicare and Medicaid
pose one of the greatest threats

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:05.834
to our federal deficit, and
could leave our children with a

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:08.834
mountain of debt
that they cannot pay.

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:11.400
We cannot continue
down this path.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.166
I don't accept a future where
Americans forego health care

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:17.033
because they can't pay for it,
and more and more families go

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:18.900
without coverage at all.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.166
And I don't accept a future
where American business is hurt

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.300
and our government goes broke.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.600
We have a responsibility
to act, and to act now.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.467
That's why I'm working with
Congress to pass reform that

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:33.633
lowers costs, improves
quality and coverage,

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:36.600
and protects consumer
health care choices.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.667
I know some question whether we
can afford to act this year.

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:42.233
But the unmistakable truth is
that it would be irresponsible

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:43.934
to not act.

00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:47.300
We can't keep shifting a growing
burden to future generations.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.500
With each passing year, health
care costs consume a larger

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.734
share of our nation's spending,
and contribute to yawning

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:56.467
deficits that we can't control.

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:59.533
So let me be clear: health
care reform is not part of the

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:01.934
problem when it comes
to our fiscal future,

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:05.133
it's a fundamental
part of the solution.

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:08.734
Real reform will mean reductions
in our long term budget.

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:12.033
And I've made a firm commitment that health care reform will not

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:15.567
add to the federal deficit
over the next decade.

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:17.900
To keep that commitment, my
Administration has already

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.967
identified how to pay for the
historic $635 billion down

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:26.033
payment on reform
detailed in our budget.

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:29.734
This includes over $300 billion
that we will save through

00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:32.433
changes like reducing Medicare
overpayments to private

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:36.967
insurers, and rooting out waste
in Medicare and Medicaid.

00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:40.400
However, any honest accounting
must prepare for the fact that

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.467
health care reform will require
additional costs in the short

00:02:43.467 --> 00:02:47.200
term in order to reduce
spending in the long-term.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.934
So today, I'm announcing an
additional $313 billion in

00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:55.166
savings that will rein
in unnecessary spending,

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:58.433
and increase efficiency
and the quality of care --

00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:03.500
savings that will ensure that we have nearly $950 billion set

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.200
aside to offset the costs of health care reform over the next ten years.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.233
These savings will come
from commonsense changes.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:13.900
For example -- if more
Americans are insured,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.367
we can cut payments that help
hospitals treat patients without

00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:18.867
health insurance.

00:03:18.867 --> 00:03:21.066
If the drug makers
pay their fair share,

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:24.166
we can cut government spending
on prescription drugs.

00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:27.600
And if doctors have incentives
to provide the best care instead

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.333
of more care, we can help
Americans avoid the unnecessary

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:36.033
hospital stays, treatments,
and tests that drive up costs.

00:03:36.033 --> 00:03:38.233
For more details about
these and other savings,

00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:43.467
you can visit our website:
www.whitehouse.gov

00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:46.800
These savings underscore the
fact that securing quality,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.033
affordable health care for the
American people is tied directly

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:52.834
to insisting upon
fiscal responsibility.

00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:55.934
And these savings are rooted in
the same principle that must

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:59.333
guide our broader approach to
reform: we will fix what's

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:02.600
broken, while building
upon what works.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.500
If you like your
plan and your doctor,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.734
you can keep them -- the only
changes that you'll see are

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:10.800
lower costs and
better health care.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.567
For too long, we've stood by
while our health care system has

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:15.400
frayed at the seams.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.734
While there has been excuse
after excuse to delay reform,

00:04:18.734 --> 00:04:22.200
the price of care has gone up
for individuals, for business,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.934
and for the government.

00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:25.734
This time must be different.

00:04:25.734 --> 00:04:28.867
This is the moment when we must
reform health care so that we

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:32.033
can build a new foundation
for our economy to grow;

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:35.066
for our people to thrive; and
for our country to pursue a

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:38.066
responsible and
sustainable path.

00:04:38.066 --> 00:04:39.400
Thanks.
