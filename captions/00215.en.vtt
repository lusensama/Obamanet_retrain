00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:09.400
The President:
Today, I'm speaking to you from
Indonesia as I finish up my trip

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.567
to the Asia-Pacific -- the
region where we do most of our

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:15.433
trade and sell most
of our exports.

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, over the past week, the
progress we've made in opening

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.133
markets and boosting exports
here will help create more jobs

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.800
and more growth in
the United States.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.433
Here in Indonesia, I was proud
to join leaders from some of our

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:30.300
nation's top companies as they
announced trade deals that will

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.533
support nearly 130,000 American
jobs and potentially increase

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:38.000
U.S. exports by
up to $39 billion.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.667
Boeing, for example, will
sell more than 200 planes to

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:43.800
Indonesia that are built with
parts from suppliers in more

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.433
than 40 states.

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:48.667
And a deal to export GE engines
will support jobs at plant in

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:51.333
Ohio and North Carolina.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.834
These agreements will help
us reach my goal of doubling

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:57.567
American exports by 2014 --
a goal we're on pace to meet.

00:00:57.567 --> 00:01:01.200
And there are powerful examples
of how we can rebuild an economy

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.467
that's focused on what our
country has always done best --

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:07.700
making and selling products all
over the world that are stamped

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.900
with three proud words:
"Made in America."

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.200
This is important because
over the last decade,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.934
we became a country that relied
too much on what we bought

00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:17.333
and consumed.

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.834
We racked up a lot of debt,
but we didn't create many

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:21.300
jobs at all.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.900
If we want an economy that's
built to last and built to

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.266
compete, we have to change that.

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:29.000
We have to restore America's
manufacturing might,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.300
which is what helped us build
the largest middle class

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.834
in history.

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:35.600
That's why we chose to pull
the auto industry back from the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.800
brink, saving hundreds
of thousands of jobs in

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.000
the process.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.266
And that's why we're investing
in the next generation of high

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.767
tech American manufacturing.

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:46.567
But building an economy that
lasts isn't just about making

00:01:46.567 --> 00:01:50.734
things -- it's about opening new
markets for people to buy them.

00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:54.166
After all, 95% of the world's
consumers live outside

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:55.166
our borders.

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:57.266
And as the fastest-growing
region in the world,

00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:00.133
no market is more important to
our economic future than the

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:03.367
Asia-Pacific region -- a
region where our exports already

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:06.300
support five million
American jobs.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.967
That's why we recently signed
a landmark trade agreement with

00:02:08.967 --> 00:02:11.700
South Korea that will support
tens of thousands of American

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.867
jobs and it's why I
traveled here this week.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:18.333
In Hawaii, I hosted leaders from
all across the Asia-Pacific and

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.800
we agreed to make it easier
for American companies to do

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.567
business overseas.

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:24.967
I also worked with President
Medvedev of Russia to pursue

00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:27.934
trade that would increase
exports and jobs for American

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:30.367
manufacturers and farmers.

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:33.033
And working with other leaders,
we made progress towards our

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:35.266
most ambitious trade
agreement yet --

00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:38.433
a partnership with Pacific
nations that hold the potential

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:41.967
for more exports and more jobs
in a region of nearly three

00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:44.200
billion consumers.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.000
We may be going
through tough times,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.133
but as I've said
time and time again,

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:52.033
the United States still has the
world's most dynamic economy,

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:55.633
the finest universities, the
most innovative companies and

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.900
hardest-working people on Earth.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.233
We can compete against
anybody and we can win.

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:04.033
As President, I intend to make
sure that happens by doing

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:07.367
everything I can to give
American workers and businesses

00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:08.667
the chance to succeed.
