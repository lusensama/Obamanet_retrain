00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:07.767
President Obama:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:11.433
Earlier this week, I spoke about
our way forward in Afghanistan,

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:13.533
and I said that because the
extraordinary work of our men

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:18.133
and women in uniform, civilians,
and our coalition partners,

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.967
we will soon begin
bringing our troops home,

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:23.700
just as we've begun
doing in Iraq.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.433
After a decade of conflict,
we're finally bringing these

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:29.200
wars to a responsible end.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.533
That's in the best interest
of America's security.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:36.266
And it's also in the best
interest of America's economy.

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.300
Even though we've turned our
economy in the right direction

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.567
over the past couple of years,
many Americans are still

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:45.200
hurting, and now is the time
to focus on nation building

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.333
here at home.

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.767
Of course, there's been a real
debate about where to invest and

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:52.934
where to cut, and I'm committed
to working with members of both

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:56.033
parties to cut our
deficits and debt.

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:59.433
But we can't simply cut
our way to prosperity.

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:02.467
We need to do what's necessary
to grow our economy;

00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:05.800
create good, middle class jobs;
and make it possible for all

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.800
Americans to pursue
their dreams.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.467
That means giving our kids the
best education in the world so

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:13.233
they have the knowledge
and skills to succeed in

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:14.867
this economy.

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:17.300
It means rebuilding our
crumbling roads, railways,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.033
and runways.

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:21.700
And it means investing in the
cutting edge research and

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.367
technologies that will spur
growth in the years ahead --

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:28.467
from clean energy to
advanced manufacturing.

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:31.867
That's why I'm here today at
Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh,

00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:35.133
one of America's leading
research universities.

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:39.600
Behind me is a display from a
company called RedZone Robotics.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.300
The robots they make are used to
explore water and sewage pipes,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.467
and find leaks and breaks before
they become expensive problems.

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:50.200
But the folks at RedZone
aren't just solving problems;

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.000
they're working with unions to
create new jobs operating the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.467
robots, and they're saving
cities millions of dollars in

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:58.734
infrastructure costs.

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:02.800
This company is just one example
of how advanced manufacturing

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.200
can help spur job creation
and economic growth across

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.767
this country.

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:10.533
That's why this week, we
launched what we're calling an

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:13.567
Advanced Manufacturing
Partnership.

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:16.000
It's a partnership that brings
our federal government together

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.767
with some of America's most
brilliant minds and some of

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:22.667
America's most innovative
companies and manufacturers.

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:25.000
Their mission is to come up with
a way to get ideas from the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.567
drawing board to the
manufacturing floor to the

00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:30.700
marketplace as
swiftly as possible,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.767
which will help
create quality jobs,

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:35.200
and make our businesses
more competitive.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.333
But they also have
a broader mission.

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:40.567
It's to renew the promise
of American manufacturing.

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:44.367
To help make sure America
remains in this century what we

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:48.166
were in the last -- a
country that makes things.

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:50.233
A country that out-builds
and out-innovates the rest

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:51.800
of the world.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.433
I know these have been
tough years for American

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:56.066
manufacturing, and all the
workers and families who've

00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:57.934
built their lives around it.

00:02:57.934 --> 00:03:01.166
But being here in Pittsburgh,
I'm hopeful about the future.

00:03:01.166 --> 00:03:04.033
I'm hopeful when I think about
how companies like RedZone are

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:08.033
reinvigorating manufacturing
or about how what started as a

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:12.800
small trade school is now a
global research university.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.367
We're a people who've always
adapted to meet the challenges

00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:19.066
of a new time; who've always
shaped our own destiny,

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:21.133
and I'm absolutely confident
that that's what we're going to

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:23.400
do one more time.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.734
Have a great weekend.

00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:25.800
Bye bye.
