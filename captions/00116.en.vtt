00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:07.467
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:09.533
On behalf of all the Obamas -

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.066
Michelle, Malia, Sasha, Bo,

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.400
and the newest member
of our family, Sunny -

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.967
I want to wish you a happy
and healthy Thanksgiving.

00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:20.433
We'll be spending today
just like many of you -

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:21.967
sitting down with
family and friends

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:24.667
to eat some good food,
tell stories,

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:25.700
watch a little football,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.567
and most importantly,
count our blessings.

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:32.333
And as Americans, we have
so much to be thankful for.

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.834
We give thanks for the men and
women who set sail for this land

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.467
nearly four centuries ago,

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:39.100
risking everything for the chance 
at a better life -

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.734
and the people who
were already here,

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:42.800
our Native American
brothers and sisters,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.133
for their generosity during
that first Thanksgiving.

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.800
We give thanks for the
generations who followed -

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.967
people of all races
and religions,

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.133
who arrived here from
every country on Earth

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.900
and worked to build something 
better for themselves

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.467
and for us.

00:00:57.467 --> 00:01:00.467
We give thanks for all our
men and women in uniform -

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:01.867
and for their families,

00:01:01.867 --> 00:01:04.633
who are surely missing
them very much today.

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:07.567
We're grateful for
their sacrifice too.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:10.400
We give thanks for
the freedoms they defend -

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.467
the freedom to think what
we want and say what we think,

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:16.000
to worship according
to our own beliefs,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.767
to choose our
leaders and, yes,

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:20.100
criticize them
without punishment.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.633
People around
the world are fighting

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:24.934
and even dying for their
chance at these freedoms.

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:26.834
We stand with them
in that struggle,

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:29.367
and we give thanks
for being free.

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:31.600
And we give thanks to everyone
who's doing their part

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.400
to make the
United States a better,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.266
more compassionate nation -

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.834
who spend their Thanksgiving 
volunteering at a soup kitchen,

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:41.100
or joining a service project,
or bringing food and cheer

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.033
to a lonely neighbor.

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:45.400
That big-hearted generosity
is a central part

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.367
of our American character.

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:50.166
We believe in lending
a hand to folks who need it.

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:52.667
We believe in pitching
in to solve problems

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:54.133
even if they aren't
our problems.

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:57.333
And that's not
a one-day-a-year belief.

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.166
It's part of the
fabric of our nation.

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:02.367
And we remember
that many Americans need

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:04.333
that helping hand right now.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.800
Americans who've lost their
jobs and can't get a new one

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.867
through no fault of their own.

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:11.066
Americans who've
been trapped in poverty

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:13.867
and just need that
helping hand to climb out.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:16.967
Citizens whose prayers
and hopes move us to act.

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:21.300
We are a people who are greater
together than we are on our own.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.300
That's what today is about.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.333
That's what every
day should be about.

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:26.800
No matter our differences,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.200
we're all part of
one American family.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.633
We are each other's keeper.

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:33.734
We are one nation, under God.

00:02:33.734 --> 00:02:37.000
That core tenet of our American
experience has guided us

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.133
from the earliest
days of our founding -

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:40.734
and it will
guide us to a future

00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:43.367
that's even
brighter than today.

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:44.800
Thank you, God bless you,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.633
and from my family to yours, 
Happy Thanksgiving.
