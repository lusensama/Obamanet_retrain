President Obama:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.767
This Father's Day weekend, I'd
like to spend a couple minutes

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:12.400
talking about what's
sometimes my hardest,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.834
but always my most rewarding
job -- being a dad.

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:19.233
I grew up without
my father around.

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:20.967
He left when I
was two years old,

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:23.166
and even though my sister and
I were lucky enough to have a

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:26.734
wonderful mom and caring
grandparents to raise us,

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:28.500
I felt his absence.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.066
And I wonder what my life would
have been like had he been a

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.700
greater presence.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.367
That's why I try pretty hard to
be a good dad for my own kids.

00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:38.266
I haven't always
succeeded, of course --

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.533
and in the past, my job's kept
me away from home more than I

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.700
often would've liked, and the
burden of raising two young

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.000
girls sometimes would fall
too heavily on Michelle.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.867
But between my own
experiences growing up,

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:53.133
and my ongoing efforts to
be the best father I can be,

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.667
I've learned a couple of things
about what our children need

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:58.066
most from their parents.

00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.800
First and foremost,
they need our time.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.033
And more important than the
quantity of hours we spend with

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:05.600
them is the quality
of those hours.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.166
Maybe it's just asking
about their day,

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.934
or talking a walk together, but
the smallest moments can have

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:12.834
the biggest impact.

00:01:12.834 --> 00:01:15.867
They also need structure,
including learning the values of

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.667
self-discipline and
responsibility.

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:20.934
Malia and Sasha may live in
the White House these days,

00:01:20.934 --> 00:01:23.500
but Michelle and I still
make sure they finish their

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.567
homework, do their
chores, and walk the dog.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:31.567
And above all, children need
our unconditional love --

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:33.867
whether they succeed
or make mistakes;

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:37.266
when life is easy and
when life is tough.

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:40.266
And life is tough for a
lot of Americans today.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.233
More and more kids grow up
without a father figure.

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:46.800
Others miss a father who's away
serving his country in uniform.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.200
And even for those dads who are
present in their children's

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.300
lives, the recession
has taken a harsh toll.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.100
If you're out of a job or
struggling to pay the bills,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.033
doing whatever it takes to keep
the kids healthy and happy and

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:04.133
safe can understandably take
precedence over everything else.

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:06.967
That's why my administration has
offered men who want to be good

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:09.567
fathers a little extra support.

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:11.967
We've boosted community and
faith-based groups focused on

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:14.533
fatherhood, partnered
with businesses to offer

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:17.433
opportunities for fathers to
spend time with their kids at a

00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:21.600
bowling alley or a ballpark, and
worked with military chaplains

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.333
to help deployed dads
connect with their children.

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:28.533
We're doing this because we all
have a stake in forging stronger

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:31.467
bonds between fathers
and their children.

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:34.200
And you can find out more about
some of what we're doing at

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.633
Fatherhood.gov.

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:38.567
But we also know that every
father has a personal

00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:42.266
responsibility to do
right by our kids as well.

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:44.600
All of us can encourage our
children to turn off the video

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.767
games and pick up a book.

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:49.133
All of us can pack a
healthy lunch for our son,

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:52.100
or go outside and play
ball with our daughter.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.700
And all of us can teach our
children the difference between

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.133
right and wrong, and show them
through our own example the

00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:02.400
value in treating one another
as we wish to be treated.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.300
Our kids are pretty smart.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.767
They understand that life
won't always be perfect,

00:03:06.767 --> 00:03:09.367
that sometimes, the
road gets rough,

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:12.633
that even great parents
don't get everything right.

00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:15.934
But more than anything, they
just want us to be a part

00:03:15.934 --> 00:03:17.734
of their lives.

00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:21.233
So recently, I took on a second
job: assistant coach for Sasha's

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:23.200
basketball team.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.667
On Sundays, we'd get the
team together to practice,

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:28.600
and a couple of times,
I'd help coach the games.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.900
And it was great fun -- even
if Sasha rolled her eyes

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.900
occasionally when her dad voiced
his displeasure with the refs.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.266
But I was so proud watching
her run up and down the court,

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:42.000
seeing her learn and
improve and gain confidence.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.100
And I was hopeful that
in the years to come,

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.600
she'd look back on experiences
like these as the ones that

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.734
helped define her as a person
-- and as a parent herself.

00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:54.667
In the end, that's what being
a parent is all about --

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:58.200
those precious moments with our
children that fill us with pride

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.100
and excitement for their future;
the chances we have to set an

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.467
example or offer
a piece of advice;

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:08.533
the opportunities to just
be there and show them that

00:04:08.533 --> 00:04:10.166
we love them.

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.633
That's something worth
remembering this Father's Day,

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:14.166
and every day.

00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:17.734
Thanks, and Happy Father's Day
to all of the dads out there.

00:04:17.734 --> 00:04:18.800
Have a great weekend.
