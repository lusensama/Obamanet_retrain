00:00:05.958 --> 00:00:07.458
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.458 --> 00:00:09.825
For the past couple of months,
I've been working with people in

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:12.625
both parties -- with the help
of business leaders and ordinary

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:15.591
Americans -- to come together
around a plan to grow the

00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:18.124
economy and shrink our deficits.

00:00:18.124 --> 00:00:21.658
It's a balanced plan -- one that
would protect the middle class,

00:00:21.658 --> 00:00:23.491
cut spending in a
responsible way,

00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:27.291
and ask the wealthiest
Americans to pay a little more.

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:29.291
And I'll keep working with
anybody who's serious about

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:32.191
getting a comprehensive
plan like this done --

00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:35.224
because it's the right thing
to do for our economic growth.

00:00:35.224 --> 00:00:38.224
But we're now at the point
where, in just a couple of days,

00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:41.391
the law says that every
American's tax rates are

00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:42.825
going up.

00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:45.958
Every American's paycheck
will get a lot smaller.

00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:49.458
And that would be the wrong
thing to do for our economy.

00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:51.291
It would hurt
middle-class families,

00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:54.958
and it would hurt the businesses
that depend on your spending.

00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:59.024
And Congress can prevent it
from happening, if they act now.

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:01.558
Leaders in Congress are working
on a way to prevent this tax

00:01:01.558 --> 00:01:04.458
hike on the middle class, and I
believe we may be able to reach

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:08.024
an agreement that can
pass both houses in time.

00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:11.358
But if an agreement
isn't reached on time,

00:01:11.358 --> 00:01:14.792
then I'll urge the Senate to
hold an up-or-down vote on a

00:01:14.792 --> 00:01:17.591
basic package that protects the
middle class from an income tax

00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:21.058
hike, extends vital unemployment
insurance for Americans looking

00:01:21.058 --> 00:01:24.525
for a job, and lays the
groundwork for future progress

00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:27.758
on more economic growth
and deficit reduction.

00:01:27.758 --> 00:01:31.358
I believe such a proposal could
pass both houses with bipartisan

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:34.825
majorities -- as long as these
leaders allow it to come

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:36.291
to a vote.

00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:39.425
If they still want to vote no,
and let tax hikes hit the middle

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:41.758
class, that's their
prerogative --

00:01:41.758 --> 00:01:44.825
but they should let
everybody else vote as well.

00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:47.158
That's the way this
is supposed to work.

00:01:47.158 --> 00:01:49.958
We just can't afford a
politically self-inflicted wound

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.325
to our economy.

00:01:51.325 --> 00:01:54.191
The economy is growing, but
keeping it that way means that

00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:58.325
the folks you sent to Washington
have to do their jobs.

00:01:58.325 --> 00:02:00.825
The housing market is healing,
but that could stall if folks

00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:02.958
are seeing smaller paychecks.

00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.991
The unemployment rate is the
lowest it's been since 2008,

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:08.625
but already, families and
businesses are starting to hold

00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:12.725
back because of the dysfunction
they see in Washington.

00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:14.158
You meet your deadlines.

00:02:14.158 --> 00:02:17.024
You meet your responsibilities
every single day.

00:02:17.024 --> 00:02:20.358
The folks you sent here to
serve should do the same.

00:02:20.358 --> 00:02:22.991
We cannot let Washington
politics get in the way of

00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:24.558
America's progress.

00:02:24.558 --> 00:02:27.391
We've got to do what it takes
to protect the middle class,

00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:31.091
grow this economy, and
move our country forward.

00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:32.091
Thanks, everybody.
