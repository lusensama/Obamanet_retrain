00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.667
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:11.300
The holiday season is a time for
remembering the bonds we share,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.533
and our obligations to
one another as human beings.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.767
But right now, more than one
million of our fellow Americans

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:21.000
are poised to lose
a vital economic lifeline

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.633
just a few days after Christmas

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:25.834
if Congress doesn't
do something about it.

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:28.700
Our top priority as a country
should be restoring opportunity

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.100
and broad-based economic
growth for all Americans.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.333
And yesterday, we learned
that our businesses

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.166
created about 200,000 jobs
in the month of November.

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.367
That's more than 8 million
new jobs in the last 45 months.

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:43.266
And the unemployment rate
fell to its lowest level

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.266
in five years.

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:47.800
But we need to do everything
we can to help businesses

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.333
create more good jobs that
pay good wages even faster.

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.233
Because the hole that
we're still digging out of

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:56.300
means that there are still 
millions of Americans

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.467
looking for work -

00:00:57.467 --> 00:00:59.133
often because
they've been laid off

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.266
through no fault of their own.

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.633
We also have to look out for
the Americans working hard

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:05.266
to get those jobs.

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.300
That's why, as a country,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.066
we offer temporary
unemployment insurance -

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.400
so that job-seekers
don't fall into poverty,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.333
and so that when
they get that job,

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.734
they bounce back more quickly.

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:17.500
For many families,
it can be the difference

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.066
between hardship
and catastrophe.

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.667
It makes a difference for a
mother who suddenly doesn't know

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:25.800
if she'll be able to put food
on the table for her kids.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.934
It makes a difference for
a father who lost his job

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:29.767
and is looking for a new one.

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:30.767
Last year alone,

00:01:30.767 --> 00:01:33.934
it lifted 2.5 million
people out of poverty,

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:36.600
and cushioned the
blow for many more.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.233
But here's the thing:
if Members of Congress don't act

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:41.233
before they leave
on their vacations,

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:44.900
1.3 million Americans
will lose this lifeline.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.467
These are people we know.

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:48.200
They're our friends
and neighbors;

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.967
they sit next to us in church

00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:51.867
and volunteer
in our communities;

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:53.734
their kids play with our kids.

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:56.000
And they include 20,000 veterans

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.667
who've served this
country with honor.

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:00.633
If Congress refuses to act,

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:02.767
it won't just hurt families 
already struggling -

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:05.266
it will actually
harm our economy.

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:08.000
Unemployment insurance is one of
the most effective ways there is

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.700
to boost our economy.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.367
When people have money to
spend on basic necessities,

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:14.934
that means more customers
for our businesses

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.066
and, ultimately, more jobs.

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:19.066
And the evidence shows
that unemployment insurance

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:22.467
doesn't stop people from
trying hard to find work.

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:25.100
Just this week, the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.900
predicted that allowing
benefits to expire

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.367
will be a drag on our
economic growth next year.

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:32.967
A report by
the Department of Labor

00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:35.233
and my Council
of Economic Advisors

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:40.266
estimated that it could
cost businesses 240,000 jobs.

00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:43.667
And without the ability to feed
their families or pay the bills,

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:46.066
many people currently
looking for work

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:48.500
could stop looking for good.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.967
So extending
unemployment insurance

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:52.367
isn't just the right thing
to do for our families -

00:02:52.367 --> 00:02:55.100
it's the smart thing
to do for our economy.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.333
And it shouldn't
be a partisan issue.

00:02:57.333 --> 00:03:01.100
For decades, Congress has voted
to offer relief to job-seekers -

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.166
including when the unemployment
rate was lower than it is today.

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:07.967
But now that economic
lifeline is in jeopardy.

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:10.367
All because Republicans
in this Congress -

00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:13.934
which is on track to be the
most unproductive in history -

00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:16.467
have so far
refused to extend it.

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:18.967
So this holiday season,
let's give our fellow Americans

00:03:18.967 --> 00:03:21.834
who are desperately looking
for work the help they need

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.500
to keep on looking.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.867
Let's make it
easier for businesses

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:28.233
to attract more customers,
and our economy to grow.

00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:30.800
And together, let's keep
doing everything we can

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.066
to make this country a place 
where anyone who works hard

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:36.333
has a chance to get ahead.

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:38.800
Thanks everybody,
and have a great weekend.
