00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.245
The President: Hi everybody.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:14.614
Seven years ago, the
American auto industry was

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:16.449
on the brink of collapse.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.817
Plants were closing.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:19.819
Hundreds of thousands of
workers were getting laid

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:21.888
off from jobs that had
been their ticket to a

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:22.889
middle-class life.

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:25.458
And as the pain spread
across the country,

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.761
another one million
Americans would have lost

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.964
their jobs in the middle of
the worst economic crisis of

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.866
our lifetimes.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.368
Some said it was too late
to turn things around.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.771
But I refused to turn my
back on so many of the

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.672
workers that I'd met.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:43.243
Instead, I placed my
bet on American workers.

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.912
I placed my bet on
American manufacturing.

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:49.215
In exchange for help, we
demanded responsibility.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.684
We said the auto industry
would have to truly change,

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.753
not just pretend
that it did.

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:56.556
We got labor and management
to settle their differences.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:59.926
We got the industry to
retool and restructure.

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:03.029
Everyone had some
skin in the game.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.898
Our plan wasn't popular.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.400
Critics said it was
a "road to socialism,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.969
" or a "disaster"
waiting to happen.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.539
But I'd make that bet
again any day of the week.

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.975
Because today, the American
auto industry is back.

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:17.944
Since our plan
went into effect,

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:21.681
our automakers have added
more than 640,000 new jobs.

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:23.783
We've cut the Detroit-area
unemployment rate by more

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:25.185
than half.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:28.354
The Big Three automakers
are raising wages.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:32.258
Seven years ago, auto
sales hit a 27-year low.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:35.628
Last year, they hit
an all-time high.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:38.665
Later this month, I'll visit
the Detroit Auto Show to see

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.200
this progress firsthand.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.336
Because I believe that every
American should be proud of

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:46.306
what our most iconic
industry has done.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:49.008
It's not unlike what America
overall has done these past

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.310
seven years.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.046
Our businesses are now on
a 70-month streak of job

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:56.850
creation, with more than
14 million new jobs in all.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.153
We've revamped our schools
and the way we pay for college.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.288
We've made historic
investments in clean energy

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:06.292
and put ourselves on a path
to a low-carbon future.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:09.095
We've brought more than 17
million Americans into our

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:11.798
health care system, seen
health care prices grow at

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.367
the lowest rate
in fifty years,

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.769
and covered more than 90
percent of our people for

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.505
the very first time.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:21.040
We've even cut our deficits
by nearly 75 percent

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.142
in the process.

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.378
The point is America
can do anything.

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:27.380
Even in times of great
challenge and change,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.283
our future is
entirely up to us.

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:32.318
That's been on my mind while
I'm writing my final State

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.453
of the Union Address.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.655
And on Tuesday, I'm going
to talk about the choices we

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:38.424
have to make to set this
country firmly on an even

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:42.161
better, brighter course
for decades to come.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.163
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
