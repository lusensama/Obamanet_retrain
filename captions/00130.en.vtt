The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:10.600
Over the past month, I've been
visiting towns across America,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.500
talking about what our
country needs to do

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.700
to secure a better bargain
for the middle class.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.400
This week, I met with high
school and college students

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.166
in New York and Pennsylvania

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:23.133
to discuss the surest path
to the middle class -

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:26.100
some form of higher education.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.867
But at a moment when
a higher education

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:29.700
has never been more important,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.367
it's also never been
more expensive.

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:33.934
That's why,
over the past four years,

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.867
we've helped make
college more affordable

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:39.400
for millions of students and
families with grants and loans

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.900
that go farther from before.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.400
But students and families and
taxpayers cannot just keep

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.100
subsidizing college costs
that keep going up and up.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.900
Not when the average
student now graduates

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.567
more than $26,000 in debt.

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:59.700
We cannot price the middle class
out of a college education.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.800
That's why I proposed major new
reforms to make college more

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.567
affordable and make
it easier for folks

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:07.767
to pay for their education.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.066
First, we're going
to start rating colleges

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.967
based on opportunity -

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:13.000
are they helping students

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.367
from all kinds
of backgrounds succeed,

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:19.867
and on outcomes - their value
to students and parents.

00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:23.000
In time, we'll use those ratings
to make sure that the colleges

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.233
that keep their tuition
down are the ones

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:28.600
that will see their
taxpayer funding go up.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.033
Second, we're going to jumpstart
competition between colleges

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:35.767
over innovations that help more
students graduate in less time,

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:38.867
at less cost,
while maintaining quality.

00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:41.500
A number of schools are
already testing new approaches,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.700
like putting more courses online
or basing course credit

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.667
on competence, not just hours
spent in the classroom.

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:51.266
And third, we're going
to help more students

00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:53.600
responsibly manage their debt,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.467
by making more
of them eligible

00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:58.834
for a loan repayment program
called Pay-As-You-Earn,

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:03.133
which caps your loan payments
at 10 percent of what you make.

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:05.767
And we'll reach out directly
to students to make sure

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:08.433
they know that
this program exists.

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:11.000
These reforms won't be
popular with everybody.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.567
But the path we're
on now is unsustainable

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:16.400
for our students
and our economy.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.200
Higher education shouldn't be a
luxury, or a roll of the dice;

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.000
it's an economic imperative that
every family in America

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.033
should be able to afford.

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:27.400
Thanks,
and have a great weekend.
