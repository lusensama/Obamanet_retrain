00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:11.544
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:15.782
This weekend, our hearts are
with the people of

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.884
San Bernardino-another American
community shattered by

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:20.487
unspeakable violence.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:23.323
We salute the first
responders-the police,

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:27.460
the SWAT teams, the EMTs-who
responded so quickly,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.197
with such courage, and saved
lives.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.700
We pray for the injured as
they fight to recover from

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.135
their wounds.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:38.071
Most of all, we stand with
14 families whose hearts are

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.672
broken.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:42.208
We're learning more about
their loved ones-the men and

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.879
women, the beautiful lives,
that were lost.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.883
They were doing what so many
of us do this time of

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:50.984
year-enjoying the holidays.

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:52.185
Celebrating with each other.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.454
Rejoicing in the bonds of
friendship and community

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:57.490
that bind us together, as
Americans.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.926
Their deaths are an absolute
tragedy,

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:02.028
not just for San Bernardino,
but for our country.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.832
We're also learning more
about the killers.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.834
And we're working to get a
full picture of their

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:12.205
motives-why they committed
these revolting acts.

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:15.108
It's important to let the
investigators do their job.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.676
We need to know all the
facts.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:19.479
And at my direction, federal
law enforcement is helping

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.548
in every way that they can.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.550
We're going to get to the
bottom of this.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:27.053
It is entirely possible that
these two attackers were

00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:29.055
radicalized to commit this
act of terror.

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:31.524
And if so, it would
underscore a threat we've

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:34.494
been focused on for
years-the danger of people

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:37.864
succumbing to violent
extremist ideologies.

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.866
We know that ISIL and other
terrorist groups are

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.235
actively encouraging
people-around the world and

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:46.139
in our country-to commit
terrible acts of violence,

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.042
often times as lone wolf
actors.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.377
And even as we work to
prevent attacks,

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:55.014
all of us-government, law
enforcement, communities,

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:59.152
faith leaders-need to work
together to prevent people

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:01.654
from falling victim to these
hateful ideologies.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:05.592
More broadly, this tragedy
reminds us of our obligation

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.594
to do everything in our
power, together,

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:10.330
to keep our communities
safe.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.465
We know that the killers in
San Bernardino used

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:16.302
military-style assault
weapons-weapons of war-to

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.972
kill as many people as they
could.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.474
It's another tragic reminder
that here in America it's

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.210
way too easy for dangerous
people to get their hands on

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.211
a gun.

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:29.282
For example, right now,
people on the No-Fly list

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:33.219
can walk into a store and
buy a gun.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.554
That is insane.

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:36.556
If you're too dangerous to
board a plane,

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:40.860
you're too dangerous, by
definition, to buy a gun.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.862
And so I'm calling on
Congress to close this

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:44.764
loophole, now.

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:46.766
We may not be able to
prevent every tragedy,

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:49.369
but-at a bare minimum-we
shouldn't be making it so

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.739
easy for potential
terrorists or criminals to

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.675
get their hands on a gun
that they could use against

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:56.676
Americans.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:01.114
Today in San Bernardino,
investigators are searching

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.615
for answers.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:05.051
Across our country, our law
enforcement professionals

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.319
are tireless.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.521
They're working around the
clock-as always-to protect

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.223
our communities.

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:12.992
As President, my highest
priority is the security and

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:15.361
safety of the American
people.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:18.731
This is work that should
unite us all-as Americans-so

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.134
that we're doing everything
in our power to defend our

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:22.669
country.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.671
That's how we can honor the
lives we lost in

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.172
San Bernardino.

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:28.241
That's how we can send a
message to all those who

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.209
would try to hurt us.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.045
We are Americans.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:37.417
We will uphold our values-a
free and open society.

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:38.418
We are strong.

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:39.419
And we are resilient.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.987
And we will not be
terrorized.
