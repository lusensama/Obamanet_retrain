00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:07.333
The President:
Hi everybody.

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.500
I hope you all had a safe
and happy Fourth of July,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.467
filled with parades, cookouts,
fireworks and family reunions.

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:17.000
We celebrated at the White House

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.467
with a few hundred members of
the military and their families.

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:21.934
And we took a moment
amid the festivities

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:25.233
to remember what our
Independence Day is all about -

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:27.233
what happened 237 years ago,

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:30.033
and what it meant to the world.

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:33.967
On July 4th, 1776,
a small band of patriots

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:37.066
declared that we were
a people created equal -

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.633
free to think and worship
and live as we please.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:43.100
It was a declaration
heard around the world -

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.433
that we were
no longer colonists,

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:47.000
we were Americans,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.700
and our destiny would
not be determined for us;

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.500
it would be determined by us.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.867
It was a bold and tremendously
brave thing to do.

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:57.900
It was also nearly unthinkable.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.200
At that time, kings and princes
and emperors ruled the world.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.100
But those patriots were certain
that a better way was possible.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.834
And to achieve it -
to win their freedom -

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.266
they were willing to
lay it all on the line.

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.266
Their lives.

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.333
Their fortunes.

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.934
Their sacred honor.

00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:15.600
They fought a revolution.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.100
Few would have bet
on our side to win.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.700
But for the first of
many times to come,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.033
America proved the
doubters wrong.

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:26.834
And now, 237 years later,
the United States -

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:28.633
this improbable nation -

00:01:28.633 --> 00:01:30.600
is the greatest in the world.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.233
A land of liberty
and opportunity.

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:36.133
A global defender
of peace and freedom.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.200
A beacon of hope
to people everywhere

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.800
who cherish those ideals.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.033
Generations of Americans made
our country what it is today -

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:47.100
farmers and teachers,
engineers and laborers,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.600
entrepreneurs
and elected leaders -

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.000
people from all walks of life,
from all parts of the world,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.500
all pulling in the
same direction.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.100
And now we, the people, must
make their task our own -

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.000
to live up to the words of that
Declaration of Independence,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.200
and secure liberty
and opportunity

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.934
for our own children,
and for future generations.

00:02:07.934 --> 00:02:10.400
I want to say
a special word of thanks

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.300
to the men and women
of our military,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.867
who have played
such a vital role

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:15.967
in the story of our nation.

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:17.834
You have defended us
at home and abroad.

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:20.100
And you have fought
on our nation's behalf

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.767
to make the world
a better, safer place.

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:25.433
People in scattered
corners of the world

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:26.967
are living in peace today,

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:28.200
free to write
their own futures,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.867
because of you.

00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:32.934
We are grateful for your
service and your sacrifice,

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:35.300
especially those still
serving in harm's way

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.567
and your families here at home.

00:02:37.567 --> 00:02:39.133
So, God bless you all.

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.867
And may God bless the
United States of America.
