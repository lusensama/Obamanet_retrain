00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.778
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:14.447
Today, there are 2.2 million
people behind bars in

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:18.585
America and millions more
on parole or probation.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:22.622
Every year, we spend $80
billion in taxpayer dollars

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:25.058
to keep people incarcerated.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:26.659
Many are non-violent
offenders serving

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.462
unnecessarily
long sentences.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:32.265
I believe we can disrupt the
pipeline from underfunded

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.068
schools to
overcrowded jails.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.936
I believe we can address
the disparities in the

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.571
application of
criminal justice,

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:41.574
from arrest rates to
sentencing to incarceration.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:44.077
And I believe we can help
those who have served their

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:47.380
time and earned a second
chance get the support they

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.050
need to become productive
members of society.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.385
That's why over the
course of this year,

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.487
I've been talking to folks
around the country about

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:57.056
reforming our criminal
justice system to make it

00:00:57.056 --> 00:01:00.326
smarter, fairer,
and more effective.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.662
In February, I sat down in
the Oval Office with police

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:05.165
officers from
around the country.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.634
In the spring, I met with
police officers and young

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:09.169
people in Camden,
New Jersey,

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:11.871
where they're using
community policing and data

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.973
to drive down crime.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.543
Over the summer, I visited
a prison in Oklahoma to talk

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.344
with inmates and
corrections officers about

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:21.247
rehabilitating prisoners,
and preventing more people

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:24.150
from ending up there
in the first place.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.486
Two weeks ago, I visited
West Virginia to meet with

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:28.488
families battling
prescription drug and heroin

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:32.192
abuse, as well as people who
are working on new solutions

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.894
for treatment and
rehabilitation.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:37.363
Last week, I traveled to
Chicago to thank police

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.532
chiefs from across the
country for all that their

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:41.768
officers do to
protect Americans,

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.704
to make sure they get
the resources to get the job

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:47.941
done, and to call for
common sense gun safety

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.176
reforms that would
make officers and their

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:52.745
communities safer.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.881
We know that having
millions of people in the

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:57.283
criminal justice system,
without any ability to find

00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:00.353
a job after release,
is unsustainable.

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:04.257
It's bad for communities and
it's bad for our economy.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:06.626
So on Monday, I'll
travel to Newark, New Jersey

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.828
to highlight
efforts to help Americans

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:11.965
who've paid their debt to
society reintegrate back

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.000
into their communities.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.236
Everyone has a role to play,
from businesses that are

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:18.771
hiring ex-offenders to
philanthropies that are

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.474
supporting education
and training programs.

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.810
And I'll keep working with
people in both parties to

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.080
get criminal justice
reform bills to my desk,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.449
including a bipartisan bill
that would reduce mandatory

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.585
minimums for non-violent
drug offenders and reward

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:35.822
prisoners with shorter
sentences if they complete

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:38.324
programs that make them less
likely to commit

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.393
a repeat offense.

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:41.995
There's a reason that good
people across the country

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.563
are coming together to
reform

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.198
our criminal justice system.

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:47.233
Because it's not
about politics.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.469
It's about whether we as
a nation live up to our

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.672
founding ideal of liberty
and justice for all.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.942
And working together, we
can make sure that we do.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.010
Thanks, everybody.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.911
Have a great weekend.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:02.148
And have a safe and
Happy Halloween.
