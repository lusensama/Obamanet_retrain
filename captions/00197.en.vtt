00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.233
The President:
Over the last few months, I've
been talking about a choice we

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:09.967
face as a country.

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:12.400
We can either settle for an
economy where a few people do

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.633
really well and everybody
else struggles to get by,

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:19.166
or we can build an economy
where hard work pays off again,

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.200
Where everyone gets a fair shot.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.233
Everyone does their fair share.

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:26.433
And everyone plays
by the same rules.

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:28.233
That's up to us.

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:31.200
And today, I want to talk to you
about the idea that everyone in

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.033
this country should
do their fair share.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.600
Now, if this were
a perfect world,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.700
we'd have unlimited resources --
no one would ever have to pay

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.900
any taxes and we could
spend as much as we wanted.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.633
But we live in
the real world --

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:45.934
we don't have
unlimited resources.

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:48.000
We have a deficit that
needs to be paid down.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.934
And we also have to pay for
investments that will help our

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:55.200
economy grow and keep our
country safe: Education;

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.600
research and technology;
a strong military;

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.233
and retirement programs like
Medicare and Social Security.

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:03.767
That means we have
to make choices.

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:06.867
When it comes to paying down the
deficit and investing in our

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.667
future, should we ask middle-class
Americans to pay even more

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.033
at a time when their budgets
are already stretched to the

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:14.667
breaking point?

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:17.400
Or should we ask some of the
wealthiest Americans to pay

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.333
their fair share?

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.333
That's the choice.

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.100
Over the last decade, we've
spent hundreds of billions of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.367
dollars on what was supposed to
be a temporary tax cut for the

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:28.934
wealthiest 2% of Americans.

00:01:28.934 --> 00:01:32.567
Now we're scheduled to spend
almost $1 trillion more.

00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:35.200
Today, the wealthiest Americans
are paying taxes at one of the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.033
lowest rates in 50 years.

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:41.367
Warren Buffett is paying a
lower rate than his secretary.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.967
Meanwhile, over
the last 30 years,

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:47.133
the tax rates for middle-class
families have barely budged.

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.600
That's not fair.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.467
It doesn't make any sense.

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.567
Do we want to keep giving
tax breaks to the wealthiest

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:56.967
Americans -- folks like myself
or Warren Buffett or Bill Gates,

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.734
people who don't need them
and never asked for them?

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:02.166
Or do we want to keep investing
in the things that will grow our

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.533
economy and keep us secure?

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:06.400
Because we can't
afford to do both.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.066
Now, some people call
this class warfare.

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:11.767
But I think asking a billionaire
to pay at least the same tax

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:15.266
rate as his secretary
is just common sense.

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:18.600
We don't envy success in this
country; we aspire to it.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.133
But we also believe that anyone
who does well for themselves

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:25.033
should do their fair share in
return so that more people have

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:28.100
the opportunity to get
ahead -- not just a few.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.367
That's the America I believe
in, and in the next few weeks,

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:33.734
members of Congress will
get a chance to show you

00:02:33.734 --> 00:02:35.333
where they stand.

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:38.433
Congress is going to vote on
what's called the Buffett Rule.

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:40.600
If you make more than
$1 million a year,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.233
you should pay at least the same
percentage of your income in

00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:46.300
taxes as middle-class
families do.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.667
On the other hand, if you
make under $250,000 a year --

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:52.066
like 98% of American
families do --

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:54.467
your taxes shouldn't go up.

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:56.800
You're the ones struggling with
the rising cost of everything

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.400
from college tuition
to groceries.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.867
You're the ones who
deserve a break.

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:03.967
So every member of Congress
is going to go on record.

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:07.233
And if they vote to keep on
giving tax breaks to people like

00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:10.266
me -- tax breaks our
country can't afford --

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:12.233
then they're going to have
to explain to you where that

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:14.000
money comes from.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.567
Either it's going to add to our
deficit or it's going to come

00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:18.133
out of your pocket.

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:21.000
Seniors will have to pay more
for their Medicare benefits.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.500
Students will see their interest
rates go up at a time when they

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.033
can't afford it.

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:27.967
Families who are scraping by
will have to do more because the

00:03:27.967 --> 00:03:30.500
richest Americans
are doing less.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.100
That's not right.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.900
That's not who we are.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.700
In America, our story has never
been about what we can do by

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.467
ourselves -- it's about
what we can do together.

00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:42.500
It's about believing in our
future and the future of

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.900
this country.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.200
So tell your members of
Congress to do the right thing.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.767
Call them up; write them a
letter; pay them a visit.

00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:53.633
And tell them to stop giving tax
breaks to people who don't need

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:56.800
them and start investing in the
things that will help grow our

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.066
economy and put
people back to work.

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:02.500
That's how we'll make this
country a little fairer,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.667
a little more just, and
a whole lot stronger.

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:06.667
Thanks.
