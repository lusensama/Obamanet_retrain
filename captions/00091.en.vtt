00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:13.961
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:14.728 --> 00:00:16.528
Sunday is Father's Day.

00:00:16.528 --> 00:00:18.027
If you haven't got Dad a
gift yet,

00:00:18.027 --> 00:00:19.561
there's still time.

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:20.994
Just barely.

00:00:20.994 --> 00:00:23.027
But the truth is, what we
give our fathers

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:26.461
can never match what our
fathers give us.

00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:27.861
I know how important it
is to have

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:28.761
a dad in your life,

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.561
because I grew up without my
father around.

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:33.494
I felt the weight
of his absence.

00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:36.428
So for Michelle and our
girls, I try every

00:00:36.428 --> 00:00:39.261
day to be the husband and father
my family didn't

00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:40.261
have when I was young.

00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:43.061
And every chance I get, I
encourage fathers

00:00:43.061 --> 00:00:45.961
to get more involved in their
children's lives,

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:48.261
because what makes you a man
isn't the ability

00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:52.061
to have a child - it's the
courage to raise one.

00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:53.961
Still, over the past
couple years,

00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:56.194
I've met with a lot of young
people who don't have

00:00:56.194 --> 00:00:57.928
a father figure around.

00:00:57.928 --> 00:01:00.761
And while there's nothing
that can replace a parent,

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:04.361
any of us can do our part
to be a mentor, a sounding

00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:08.227
board, a role model for
a kid who needs one.

00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:09.828
Earlier this year, I
launched an initiative

00:01:09.828 --> 00:01:12.695
called My Brother's Keeper
- an all-hands-on-deck

00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:14.594
effort to help more of our
young

00:01:14.594 --> 00:01:16.728
men reach their full potential.

00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:18.728
And if you want to be a
mentor

00:01:18.728 --> 00:01:21.561
to a young man in your
community, you can find

00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:26.227
out how at
WhiteHouse.gov/MyBrothersKeeper

00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:28.895
Now, when I launched this
initiative,

00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:31.695
I said that government can't
play the primary role

00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:33.528
in a young person's life.

00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:35.628
Taking responsibility for
being a great parent

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:38.227
or mentor is a choice that
we, as individuals,

00:01:38.227 --> 00:01:39.795
have to make.

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:41.861
No government program can
ever take the place

00:01:41.861 --> 00:01:43.561
of a parent's love.

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:46.194
Still, as a country, there
are ways

00:01:46.194 --> 00:01:49.961
we can help support dads and
moms who make that choice.

00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:51.961
That's why, earlier this
week, we brought

00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:54.328
working dads from across America
to the White House

00:01:54.328 --> 00:01:56.494
to talk about the challenges
they face.

00:01:56.494 --> 00:01:58.761
And in a few weeks, I'll
hold the first-ever

00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:01.394
White House Working
Families Summit.

00:02:01.394 --> 00:02:03.127
We've still got too many
workplace policies

00:02:03.127 --> 00:02:05.528
that belong in the 1950s, and
it's time to bring them

00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:07.728
up to date for today's
families,

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:10.428
where oftentimes, both
parents are working.

00:02:10.428 --> 00:02:13.628
Moms and dads deserve
affordable child care, and

00:02:13.628 --> 00:02:16.261
time off to care for a
sick parent or child

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:18.194
without running
into hardship.

00:02:18.194 --> 00:02:20.328
Women deserve equal pay
for equal work -

00:02:20.328 --> 00:02:23.261
and at a time when more women
are breadwinners for a family,

00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:25.628
that benefits men, too.

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:27.728
And because no parent who
works full-time should

00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:30.528
have to raise a family in
poverty, it's time

00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:33.795
for Congress to follow the
lead of state after state,

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:37.261
get on the bandwagon, and
give America a raise.

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:38.528
Dads work hard.

00:02:38.528 --> 00:02:40.528
So our country should do
what we can to make sure

00:02:40.528 --> 00:02:42.861
their hard work pays off;
to make sure life

00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:44.828
for them and their families is a
little less stressful,

00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:47.061
and a little more secure, so
they

00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:49.895
can be the dads their kids need them to be.

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:51.161
Because there's nothing
more precious

00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:53.828
in life than the time we spend
with our children.

00:02:53.828 --> 00:02:55.528
There's no better feeling
than knowing that

00:02:55.528 --> 00:02:58.061
we can be there for them, and
provide for them,

00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:01.061
and help give them every
shot at success.

00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:02.895
Let's make sure every dad
who works hard

00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:05.461
and takes responsibility has the
chance to know that

00:03:05.461 --> 00:03:08.294
feeling, not just on one
Sunday,

00:03:08.294 --> 00:03:10.194
but every day of the year.

00:03:10.194 --> 00:03:12.428
Thanks everybody, happy
Father's Day,

00:03:12.428 --> 00:03:13.428
and have a great weekend.
