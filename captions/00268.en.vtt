00:00:05.591 --> 00:00:08.558
The President:
The other day, I was talking about education with some folks

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:11.325
in the backyard of an
Albuquerque home,

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:14.224
and someone asked a question
that's stayed with me.

00:00:14.224 --> 00:00:17.325
He asked, if we don't have homes
to go to,

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:19.692
what good is an education?

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:23.358
It was a heartfelt question, one
that could be asked by anyone

00:00:23.358 --> 00:00:26.425
who's lost a home or a job in
this recession.

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:29.458
Because if you're out of work or
facing foreclosure,

00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:32.692
all that really matters is a new
job.

00:00:32.692 --> 00:00:35.625
All that really matters is a
roof over your head.

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:38.958
All that really matters is
getting back on your feet.

00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.358
That's why I'm fighting each and
every day to jumpstart

00:00:41.358 --> 00:00:43.892
job-creation in the private
sector;

00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:46.892
to help our small business
owners grow and hire;

00:00:46.892 --> 00:00:49.925
to rebuild our economy so it
lifts up a middle class that's

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:52.358
been battered for so long.

00:00:52.358 --> 00:00:55.325
But even as we focus on doing
all that;

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:58.925
even as we focus on speeding up
our economic recovery;

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:02.058
we also know that when it comes
to jobs, opportunity,

00:01:02.058 --> 00:01:04.625
and prosperity in the 21st
century,

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:08.925
nothing is more important than
the quality of your education.

00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:11.658
At a time when most of the new
jobs being created will require

00:01:11.658 --> 00:01:15.591
some kind of higher education;
when countries that out-educate

00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:18.124
us today will outcompete us
tomorrow,

00:01:18.124 --> 00:01:20.858
giving our kids the best
education possible is an

00:01:20.858 --> 00:01:23.058
economic imperative.

00:01:23.058 --> 00:01:25.491
That's why, from the start of my
administration,

00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:28.024
we've been fighting to offer
every child in this country a

00:01:28.024 --> 00:01:31.958
world-class education -- from the cradle to the classroom,

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.625
from college through a career.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:38.458
Earlier this week, I announced a
new Skills for America's Future

00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:41.291
initiative that will help
community colleges and employers

00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:44.758
match what's taught in the
classroom with what's needed in

00:01:44.758 --> 00:01:47.825
the private sector, so we can
connect students looking for

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:51.124
jobs with businesses looking to
hire.

00:01:51.124 --> 00:01:53.692
We're eliminating tens of
billions of dollars in wasteful

00:01:53.692 --> 00:01:56.792
subsidies for banks to
administer student loans,

00:01:56.792 --> 00:01:59.625
and using that money to make
college more affordable for

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:01.591
millions of students.

00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:04.725
And we've launched a Race to the
Top in our states to make sure

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:08.692
our students, all of them, are
graduating from high school

00:02:08.692 --> 00:02:12.024
ready for college -- so we can meet our goal of graduating a

00:02:12.024 --> 00:02:15.458
higher proportion of students from college than any other

00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:18.725
country in the world by 2020.

00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:22.391
And yet, if Republicans in
Congress had their way,

00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:25.325
we'd have had a harder time meeting that goal.

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:27.425
We'd have had a harder time offering our kids the best

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:29.291
education possible.

00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:33.391
Because they'd have cut education by 20% --

00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:37.325
cuts that would reduce financial
aid for eight million students;

00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:40.258
cuts that would leave our great
and undervalued community

00:02:40.258 --> 00:02:42.725
colleges without the resources
they need to prepare our

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:45.625
graduates for the jobs of the
future.

00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:48.091
Now, it's true that when it comes to our budget,

00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:50.091
we have real challenges to meet.

00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:51.925
And if we're serious about
getting our fiscal house in

00:02:51.925 --> 00:02:55.291
order, we'll need to make some
tough choices.

00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:57.358
I'm prepared to make those
choices.

00:02:57.358 --> 00:03:02.091
But what I'm not prepared to do
is to shortchange our children's education.

00:03:02.091 --> 00:03:05.258
What I'm not prepared to do is
undercut their economic future,

00:03:05.258 --> 00:03:08.291
your economic future, or the
economic future of the United

00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:10.525
States of America.

00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:13.425
Nothing would be more
detrimental to our prospects for

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:16.458
success than cutting back on
education.

00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:19.024
It would consign America to
second place in our fiercely

00:03:19.024 --> 00:03:21.258
competitive global economy.

00:03:21.258 --> 00:03:24.091
But China and India aren't
playing for second.

00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:27.458
South Korea and Germany -- they aren't playing for second.

00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:32.525
They're playing for first -- and so should the United States of America.

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:35.658
Instead of being shortsighted
and shortchanging our kids,

00:03:35.658 --> 00:03:37.892
we should be doubling down on
them.

00:03:37.892 --> 00:03:40.391
We should be giving every child
in America a chance to make the

00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:44.725
most of their lives; to fulfill
their God-given potential.

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:47.158
We should be fighting to lead
the global economy in this

00:03:47.158 --> 00:03:49.925
century, just like we did in the
last.

00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:52.491
And that's what I'll continue
fighting to do in the months and

00:03:52.491 --> 00:03:54.158
years ahead.

00:03:54.158 --> 00:03:56.758
Thanks, everybody, and have a
great weekend.
