00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.300
The President:
This week, Congress reached an
agreement that's going to allow

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.700
us to make some progress
in reducing our nation's

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.367
budget deficit.

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:14.734
And through this compromise,
both parties are going to have

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:17.700
to work together on a larger
plan to get our nation's

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.266
finances in order.

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.900
That's important.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.633
We've got to make sure that
Washington lives within its

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:24.867
means, just like families do.

00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:28.166
In the long term, the health
of our economy depends on it.

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:31.266
But in the short term, our
urgent mission has to be getting

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:34.934
this economy growing faster
and creating more jobs.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.800
That's what's on people's minds.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.533
That's what matters to
families in this country.

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:43.800
And the fact is, this has been a
tumultuous year for the economy.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.734
We've weathered the Arab
Spring's effect on oil and gas

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:49.400
prices; the Japanese earthquake
and tsunami's effect on supply

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.967
chains; the economic
situation in Europe.

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:55.567
And in Washington, there was
a contentious debate over our

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:58.000
nation's budget that nearly
dragged our country into

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.567
financial crisis.

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:02.700
So our job right now has to be
doing whatever we can to help

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.467
folks find work, to help create
the climate where business can

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:09.633
put up that job listing;
where incomes are rising again

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.000
for people.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.967
We've got to rebuild this
economy and the sense of

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:15.934
security that middle-class
families have felt slipping

00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:17.667
away for years.

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:19.867
And while deficit reduction
has to be part of our economic

00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:23.834
strategy, it's not the
only thing we have to do.

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:26.567
We need Democrats and
Republicans to work together to

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:28.533
help grow this economy.

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.300
We've got to put politics
aside to get some things done.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.867
That's what the American
people expect of us.

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:36.734
And there are a number of steps
that Congress can take right

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:39.433
away when they
return in September.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.900
We need to extend tax cuts
for working and middle-class

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.066
families so you have more money
in your paychecks next year.

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:48.834
That would help millions of
people to make ends meet.

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:51.667
And that extra money for
expenses means businesses will

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:56.300
have more customers and will be
in a better position to hire.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.834
Yesterday, I proposed a new tax
credit for companies that hire

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:00.800
veterans who are looking
for work after serving

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.400
their country.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.600
We've got a lot of honorable and
skilled people returning from

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.467
Iraq and Afghanistan, and
companies that could benefit

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:09.233
from their abilities.

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:11.200
Let's put them together.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.667
We need to make sure that
millions of workers who are

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.934
still pounding the pavement
looking for jobs are not denied

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:20.433
unemployment benefits to carry
them through hard times.

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:23.100
We've got to cut red tape that
stops too many inventors and

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.000
entrepreneurs from quickly
turning new ideas into thriving

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.967
businesses, which holds
back our whole economy.

00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:32.767
It's time Congress finally
passed a set of trade deals that

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:35.533
would help displaced workers
looking for new jobs and that

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:38.200
would allow our businesses to
sell more products in countries

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.734
in Asia and South America --
products stamped with three

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:44.467
words -- Made in America.

00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:46.266
And we ought to give more
opportunities to all those

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.734
construction workers who lost
their jobs when the housing

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:50.367
boom went bust.

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:53.567
We could put them to work right
now by giving loans to companies

00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:56.500
that want to repair our roads
and bridges and airports,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.300
helping to rebuild America.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.367
Those are a few common sense
steps that would help the

00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:04.867
economy, and these are ideas
that have been supported by both

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:07.834
Democrats and
Republicans in the past.

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:10.433
So I'm going to keep calling on
both parties in Congress to put

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:13.667
aside their differences and send
these bills to my desk so I can

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:15.700
sign them right away.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.600
After all, both
parties share power.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.667
Both parties share
responsibility for our progress.

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:24.533
Moving our economy and our
country forward is not a

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:27.934
Democratic or a
Republican responsibility.

00:03:27.934 --> 00:03:31.233
It is our responsibility
as Americans.

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:34.200
That's the spirit we need
in Washington right now.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.567
That's how we'll get this
economy growing faster and reach

00:03:36.567 --> 00:03:38.133
a brighter day.

00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:40.300
Thanks for listening,
and have a great weekend.
