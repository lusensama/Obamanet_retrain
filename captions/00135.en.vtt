00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:07.400
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.500
Three years ago this weekend, we
put in place tough new rules

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.767
of the road for the financial
sector so that irresponsible

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:17.033
behavior on the part of the few
could never again cause a crisis

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:19.734
that harms millions of
middle-class families.

00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:23.100
As part of that reform, we
set up the Consumer Financial

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.000
Protection Bureau, the
first-ever independent consumer

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.066
watchdog with one job: to
protect families from that

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.834
sort of behavior.

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:36.300
Two years ago, I nominated
a man named Rich Cordray,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.166
a former attorney
general from Ohio,

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.367
to run this consumer
protection bureau.

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:43.500
But Republicans in the Senate
refused to give him a simple

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.367
up-or-down vote, not because
they didn't think he was the

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:50.667
right person for the job, but
because they didn't like the law

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:54.166
that set up the consumer
watchdog in the first place.

00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:57.967
So last year, I acted on my own
to put him in charge -- because

00:00:57.967 --> 00:01:01.934
without a director, the CFPB
couldn't use all the tools

00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:04.867
at its disposal to protect
consumers from shady mortgage

00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:08.400
lenders, or unscrupulous
credit reporting agencies,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.633
or predatory lenders who
targeted veterans and seniors.

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:16.500
And I'm pleased to say that Rich Cordray was finally confirmed

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.633
this week by a bipartisan vote.

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:21.834
Because of the work that's been
done at the CFPB over the past

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:25.834
two years, today, mortgage
lenders, student lenders,

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:28.467
payday lenders, and credit
reporting and debt collection

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:31.300
agencies all face
greater scrutiny.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.000
And if they don't
play by the rules,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.800
you now have somewhere to go
to get some measure of justice.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.166
In fact, the CFPB has already
addressed more than 175,000

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.867
complaints from every state.

00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:47.834
Today, as part of the CFPB's
"Know Before You Owe" efforts,

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:50.667
students and their parents can
get a simple report with the

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:53.867
information they need to make
informed decisions before taking

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:57.567
out student loans -- and more
than 700 colleges have stepped

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:02.000
up to make this information
clear and transparent.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.266
And if you've noticed that some
credit card forms are actually

00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:06.967
easier to understand
than they used to be,

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:09.033
that's because of the work that
Rich's team and others

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:10.900
in the Administration have done.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.166
Today, veterans have the tools
they need to defend against

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:17.133
dishonest lenders and mortgage
brokers who try to prey on them

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:19.266
when they come home.

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:21.433
Seniors are better protected
from someone who sees their

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:24.700
homes or retirement
savings as an easy target.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.400
And thanks to the hard
work of folks at the CFPB,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.266
so far six million Americans
have gotten more than

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:34.867
$400 million in refunds from
companies that engaged

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:37.433
in unscrupulous practices.

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:40.633
That's money we didn't have
the power to recover before.

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:42.166
You know, we've come a long way
over the past

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:43.934
four and a half years.

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:45.300
Our economy's growing.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.667
Our businesses have created 7.2
million new jobs

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:50.800
in the past 40 months.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.934
We've locked in new safeguards
to protect against another

00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:55.467
crisis and end
bailouts for good.

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:57.700
And even though
more work remains,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.800
our financial system is more
fair and much more sound

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.834
than it was.

00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:05.400
We've still got a long way to go
to restore the sense of security

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.533
that too many middle-class
families are still

00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:09.266
fighting to rebuild.

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:12.367
But if we keep moving forward
with our eyes fixed on that

00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:15.233
North Star of a
growing middle class,

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:18.100
then I'm confident we'll
get to where we need to go.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.633
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
