The President:
From my family to yours,
I'd like to wish you a

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:09.767
happy Thanksgiving.

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:11.834
Like millions of Americans,
Michelle, Malia,

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:14.400
Sasha and I will spend
the day eating great food,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.767
watching a little football,
and reflecting on how truly

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.767
lucky we are.

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:22.900
As Americans, each of us has our
own list of things and people to

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.900
be thankful for.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.433
But there are some
blessings we all share.

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:29.800
We're especially grateful for
the men and women who defend our

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.633
country overseas.

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:34.100
To all the service members
eating Thanksgiving dinner far

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.967
from your families: the
American people are thinking of

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:37.967
you today.

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:40.800
And when you come home, we
intend to make sure that we

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.934
serve you as well as
you're serving America.

00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:46.467
We're also grateful for the
Americans who are taking time

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:50.033
out of their holiday to serve
in soup kitchens and shelters,

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:54.233
making sure their neighbors have
a hot meal and a place to stay.

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:56.633
This sense of mutual
responsibility --

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:58.333
the idea that I'm
my brother's keeper;

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:01.467
that I'm my sister's keeper --
has always been part of what

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:02.600
makes our country special.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.834
And it's one of the reasons
the Thanksgiving tradition

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:07.667
has endured.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.233
The very first Thanksgiving
was a celebration of community

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:13.433
during a time of great hardship,
and we've followed that example

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:14.834
ever since.

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:18.000
Even when the fate of our
union was far from certain --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.600
during a Civil War, two World
Wars, a Great Depression --

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.700
Americans drew strength
from each other.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.367
They had faith that tomorrow
would be better than today.

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:31.166
We're grateful that they did.

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.667
As we gather around the table,
we pause to remember the

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:37.133
pilgrims, pioneers and patriots
who helped make this country

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.567
what it is.

00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:43.233
They faced impossible odds, and
yet somehow, they persevered.

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:45.700
Today, it's our turn.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.934
I know that for many of you,
this Thanksgiving is more

00:01:47.934 --> 00:01:49.467
difficult than most.

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:51.934
But no matter how tough
things are right now,

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:55.133
we still give thanks for that
most American of blessings,

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:57.233
the chance to determine
our own destiny.

00:01:57.233 --> 00:02:00.734
The problems we face
didn't develop overnight,

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.567
and we won't solve
them overnight.

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:04.734
But we will solve them.

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:07.100
All it takes is for each
of us to do our part.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.066
With all the partisanship and
gridlock here in Washington,

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:14.533
it's easy to wonder if such
unity is really possible.

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:17.233
But think about what's
happening at this very moment:

00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:20.066
Americans from all walks of
life are coming together as one

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:23.567
people, grateful for the
blessings of family, community,

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:25.066
and country.

00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:29.533
If we keep that spirit alive, if
we support each other and look

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:32.633
out for each other and remember
that we're all in this together,

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:36.133
then I know that we, too,
will overcome the challenges

00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:37.633
of our time.

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:40.600
So today, I'm thankful to
serve as your President and

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.600
Commander-in-Chief.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.834
I'm thankful that my daughters
get to grow up in this great

00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:45.900
country of ours.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.800
And I'm thankful for the chance
to do my part, as together,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.266
we make tomorrow
better than today.

00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:55.100
Thanks, and have a
wonderful Thanksgiving.
