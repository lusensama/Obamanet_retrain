00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:07.633
The President:
Almost three weeks ago in Syria,

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:09.900
more than 1,000
innocent people -

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.033
including hundreds
of children -

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.734
were murdered in the worst
chemical weapons attack

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:16.667
of the 21st century.

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:19.133
And the United States has
presented a powerful case

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:22.367
to the world that the Syrian 
government was responsible

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:25.667
for this horrific attack
on its own people.

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:28.934
This was not only a direct
attack on human dignity;

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:31.800
it is a serious threat
to our national security.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.033
There's a reason governments

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:36.033
representing 98 percent of 
the world's people have agreed

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:39.333
to ban the use
of chemical weapons.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.467
Not only because they cause
death and destruction

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:44.600
in the most indiscriminate
and inhumane way possible -

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.400
but because they can
also fall into the hands

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.700
of terrorist groups
who wish to do us harm.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.233
That's why, last weekend,

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:53.667
I announced that,
as Commander in Chief,

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:56.900
I decided that the United States
should take military action

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.467
against the Syrian regime.

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:02.133
This is not a decision
I made lightly.

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.834
Deciding to use military force

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:07.834
is the most solemn decision
we can make as a nation.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:11.100
As the leader of the world's
oldest Constitutional democracy,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.066
I also know that our
country will be stronger

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.767
if we act together,

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:17.533
and our actions will
be more effective.

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.200
That's why I asked
Members of Congress

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.200
to debate this issue and vote
on authorizing the use of force.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.133
What we're talking about is
not an open-ended intervention.

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:29.066
This would not be another
Iraq or Afghanistan.

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:32.066
There would be no American
boots on the ground.

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.433
Any action we take
would be limited,

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:36.433
both in time and scope -

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:38.500
designed to deter
the Syrian government

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.433
from gassing its
own people again

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:44.166
and degrade its
ability to do so.

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:47.367
I know that the American people
are weary after a decade of war,

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:49.166
even as the war
in Iraq has ended,

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.300
and the war in Afghanistan
is winding down.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.400
That's why we're not
putting our troops

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.200
in the middle
of somebody else's war.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.567
But we are the
United States of America.

00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:01.867
We cannot turn
a blind eye to images

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:04.467
like the ones we've
seen out of Syria.

00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:07.834
Failing to respond to this
outrageous attack would increase

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:11.000
the risk that chemical
weapons could be used again;

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.333
that they would fall into the
hands of terrorists who might

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.734
use them against us, and it
would send a horrible signal

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:19.934
to other nations that there
would be no consequences

00:02:19.934 --> 00:02:22.600
for their use of these weapons.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.633
All of which would
pose a serious threat

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:26.867
to our national security.

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:28.133
That's why we can't ignore

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:30.734
chemical weapons
attacks like this one -

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:33.200
even if they happen
halfway around the world.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.300
And that's why I call
on Members of Congress,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.734
from both parties,

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:38.600
to come together and stand up

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.033
for the kind of world
we want to live in;

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:43.333
the kind of world we want
to leave our children

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:45.700
and future generations.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.100
Thank you.
