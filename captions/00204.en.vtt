00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:10.728
The President:
Over the last couple of weeks,
I've been traveling around the

00:00:10.728 --> 00:00:13.294
country and talking with folks
about my blueprint for an

00:00:13.294 --> 00:00:15.394
economy built to last.

00:00:15.394 --> 00:00:18.061
It's a blueprint that focuses
on restoring the things we've

00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:19.728
always done best.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.294
Our strengths.

00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:23.094
American manufacturing.

00:00:23.094 --> 00:00:24.895
American energy.

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:28.494
The skills and education
of American workers.

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:31.561
And most importantly,
American values like fairness

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:33.795
and responsibility.

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:36.127
We know what happened when we
strayed from those values over

00:00:36.127 --> 00:00:38.628
the past decade -- especially
when it comes to our

00:00:38.628 --> 00:00:40.161
housing market.

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:43.461
Lenders sold loans to families
who couldn't afford them.

00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:46.061
Banks packaged those mortgages
up and traded them for

00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:47.795
phony profits.

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:51.428
It drove up prices and created
an unsustainable bubble that

00:00:51.428 --> 00:00:54.628
burst -- and left millions of
families who did everything

00:00:54.628 --> 00:00:57.161
right in a world of hurt.

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:58.728
It was wrong.

00:00:58.728 --> 00:01:01.695
The housing crisis has been
the single biggest drag on our

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:03.594
recovery from the recession.

00:01:03.594 --> 00:01:07.127
It has kept millions of families
in debt and unable to spend,

00:01:07.127 --> 00:01:09.895
and it has left hundreds of
thousands of construction

00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:11.294
workers out of a job.

00:01:11.294 --> 00:01:14.127
But there's something even
more important at stake.

00:01:14.127 --> 00:01:16.628
I've been saying this is a
make-or-break moment for the

00:01:16.628 --> 00:01:17.961
middle class.

00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:20.928
And the housing crisis struck
right at the heart of what it

00:01:20.928 --> 00:01:24.728
means to be middle-class in
this country: owning a home.

00:01:24.728 --> 00:01:26.227
Raising our kids.

00:01:26.227 --> 00:01:28.027
Building our dreams.

00:01:28.027 --> 00:01:30.161
Right now, there are more than
10 million homeowners in this

00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:33.027
country who, because of a
decline in home prices that is

00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:35.994
no fault of their own, owe more
on their mortgages than their

00:01:35.994 --> 00:01:37.628
homes are worth.

00:01:37.628 --> 00:01:40.294
It's wrong for anyone to
suggest that the only option for

00:01:40.294 --> 00:01:43.428
struggling, responsible
homeowners is to sit and wait

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:45.294
for the housing
market to hit bottom.

00:01:45.294 --> 00:01:46.661
I don't accept that.

00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:48.094
None of us should.

00:01:48.094 --> 00:01:50.461
That's why we launched a plan a
couple years ago that's helped

00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:53.261
nearly one million responsible
homeowners refinance their

00:01:53.261 --> 00:01:56.094
mortgages and save an
average of $300 on their

00:01:56.094 --> 00:01:57.861
payments each month.

00:01:57.861 --> 00:01:59.928
I'll be the first to admit
it didn't help as many folks

00:01:59.928 --> 00:02:01.061
as we'd hoped.

00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:04.027
But that doesn't mean we
shouldn't keep trying.

00:02:04.027 --> 00:02:06.961
That's why I'm sending Congress
a plan that will give every

00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:10.294
responsible homeowner the
chance to save about $3,000

00:02:10.294 --> 00:02:13.261
a year on their mortgages
by refinancing at

00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:15.227
historically low rates.

00:02:15.227 --> 00:02:16.594
No more red tape.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.394
No more endless forms.

00:02:18.394 --> 00:02:21.227
And a small fee on the largest
financial institutions will make

00:02:21.227 --> 00:02:24.561
sure it doesn't add a
dime to the deficit.

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.728
I want to be clear: this plan
will not help folks who bought a

00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:30.494
house they couldn't afford
and then walked away from it.

00:02:30.494 --> 00:02:33.027
It won't help folks who bought
multiple houses just to turn

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:35.695
around and sell
them in speculation.

00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:38.994
What this plan will do is
help millions of responsible

00:02:38.994 --> 00:02:42.194
homeowners who make their
payments every month, but who,

00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:45.861
until now, couldn't refinance
because their home values kept

00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:49.961
dropping or they got wrapped
up in too much red tape.

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:51.461
Here's the catch.

00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:54.027
In order to lower mortgage
payments for millions of

00:02:54.027 --> 00:02:57.594
Americans, we need
Congress to act.

00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:00.061
They're the ones who
have to pass this plan.

00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:02.294
And as anyone who has followed
the news in the last six months

00:03:02.294 --> 00:03:05.261
can tell you, getting Congress
to do anything these days is not

00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:06.494
an easy job.

00:03:06.494 --> 00:03:08.928
That's why I'm going to keep up
the pressure on Congress to do

00:03:08.928 --> 00:03:10.194
the right thing.

00:03:10.194 --> 00:03:11.828
But I also need your help.

00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:13.261
I need your voice.

00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:16.261
I need everyone who agrees with
this plan to get on the phone,

00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:18.728
send an email,
tweet, pay a visit,

00:03:18.728 --> 00:03:22.861
and remind your representatives
in Washington who they work for.

00:03:22.861 --> 00:03:24.795
Tell them to pass this plan.

00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:27.628
Tell them to help more
families keep their homes,

00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:30.795
and more neighborhoods
stay vibrant and whole.

00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:32.961
The truth is, it will take
time for our housing market

00:03:32.961 --> 00:03:34.361
to recover.

00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:36.994
It will take time for our
economy to fully bounce back.

00:03:36.994 --> 00:03:39.528
But there are steps we
can take, right now,

00:03:39.528 --> 00:03:41.494
to move this country forward.

00:03:41.494 --> 00:03:43.928
That's what I promise
to do as your President,

00:03:43.928 --> 00:03:46.561
and I hope Members of
Congress will join me.

00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:48.261
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
