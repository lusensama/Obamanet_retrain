00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.767
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:14.467
Earlier this week
was Equal Pay Day.

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:17.367
It marks the extra time
the average woman has

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:19.900
to work into a new year to
earn what

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.533
a man earned the year before.

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.800
You see, the average woman
who works full-time

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.367
in America earns less than a
man - even when she's

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:30.667
in the same profession and
has the same education.

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:33.400
That's wrong.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.533
In 2014, it's an
embarrassment.

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.500
Women deserve equal
pay for equal work.

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:43.834
This is an economic issue
that affects all of us.

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:46.066
Women make up about
half our workforce.

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.233
And more and more, they're

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:49.600
our families' main breadwinners.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.767
So it's good for everyone
when women

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:53.800
are paid fairly.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.900
That's why, this week, I
took action to prohibit

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.867
more businesses from
punishing workers

00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:00.567
who discuss their salaries
- because more pay

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:02.233
transparency makes it
easier

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:03.667
to spot pay discrimination.

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:05.967
And I hope more business
leaders will

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:06.967
take up this cause.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:09.433
But equal pay is just one
part

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:11.867
of an economic agenda for women.

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:14.533
Most lower-wage workers
in America are women.

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.700
So I've taken executive
action to require

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.967
federal contractors to pay their
federally-funded employees

00:01:19.967 --> 00:01:23.033
at least ten dollars
and ten cents an hour.

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:25.767
I ordered a review of our
nation's overtime rules,

00:01:25.767 --> 00:01:27.467
to give more workers
the chance to earn

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:30.800
the overtime pay they deserve.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.400
Thanks to the Affordable
Care Act,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.166
tens of millions of women are
now guaranteed free preventive

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.467
care like mammograms and
contraceptive care,

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:41.100
and the days when you could
be charged more just

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.567
for being a woman are
over for good.

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:46.367
Across the country,
we're bringing Americans

00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:48.633
together to help us make
sure that a woman

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:51.467
can have a baby without
sacrificing her job,

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:53.467
or take a day off to care for a sick child

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:55.934
or parent without hitting hardship.

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:58.700
It's time to do away with
workplace policies that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.200
belong in a "Mad Men"
episode,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.834
and give every woman the
opportunity she deserves.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.166
Here's the
problem, though.

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:09.400
On issues that would
benefit millions of women,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.900
Republicans in Congress
have blocked

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.333
progress at every turn.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.400
Just this week, Senate
Republicans blocked

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.567
the Paycheck Fairness Act,
commonsense legislation

00:02:18.567 --> 00:02:20.834
that would help more women
win equal pay

00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:22.734
for equal work.

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:24.767
House Republicans won't
vote to raise the minimum

00:02:24.767 --> 00:02:26.967
wage or extend
unemployment insurance

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:30.500
for women out of work through
no fault of their own.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.400
The budget they passed
this week would force

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.333
deep cuts to investments that
overwhelmingly benefit

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:38.700
women and children - like
Medicaid, food stamps,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.567
and college grants.

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:42.367
And of course, they're
trying to repeal the

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:45.066
Affordable Care Act for
the fiftieth or so time,

00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:47.500
which would take away
vital benefits

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.066
and protections from
millions of women.

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:51.700
I'm going to keep fighting
to make sure

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.834
that doesn't happen.

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:55.266
Because we do better when
our economy grows

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:57.900
for everybody, not just a few.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.567
And when women succeed,
America succeeds.

00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:03.333
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
