The President:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:10.600
I'm speaking to you today from a
UPS customer center in Landover,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.800
Maryland, where I came to talk
about an issue that's affecting

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.734
families and businesses
just like this one --

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:20.300
the rising price of gas, and
what we can do as a country to

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.233
reduce our dependence
on foreign oil.

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:27.367
This week, I released a
Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future.

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:29.967
It's a strategy to reduce the
oil we import from around the

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:33.767
world, and to make our
economy stronger at home.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.767
Part of this strategy involves
increasing our oil exploration

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:38.667
right here in America.

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:42.300
In fact, our oil production last
year reached its highest level

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.667
since 2003, and we want
to encourage more safe,

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:50.100
responsible drilling
where we can.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.066
But the truth is, drilling
alone is not a real strategy to

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.533
replace our dependence
on foreign oil.

00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.400
And that's because even though
America uses 25% of the world's

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.000
oil, we currently have only
about 2% of the world's oil reserves.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.800
Even if we used every last
drop of all the oil we have,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.734
it wouldn't be enough to meet
our long-term energy needs.

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:15.800
So, real energy security can
only come if we find ways to use

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.000
less oil -- if we invest in
cleaner fuels and greater efficiency.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.600
That's what we've been
doing since I took office.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.367
For example, we secured an
agreement from all the major

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:29.834
auto companies to raise the fuel
efficiency standards of their

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:31.533
cars and trucks.

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.867
So if you buy a new car, the
better gas mileage is going to

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:37.633
save you about $3,000.

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:42.000
Altogether, this will save us
about 1.8 billion barrels of oil

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.800
as a country.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.133
So we need to build
on that progress.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.500
As we make our cars and
trucks more efficient,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.066
we've got to harness new
technologies to fuel our

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:54.800
vehicles with everything from
biofuels to natural gas to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.467
advanced batteries.

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:58.834
And the good news is, these
technologies aren't science

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:00.467
fiction anymore.

00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:02.266
They exist today.

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:06.100
Already, American car companies
are producing electric vehicles

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.500
that use little or no gas.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.867
And innovators across America
are testing new products that

00:02:11.867 --> 00:02:15.266
hold incredible promise
not just for new vehicles,

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:17.867
but for countless new jobs.

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:19.967
To help jumpstart this market,
the federal government has

00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:24.266
doubled the number of clean energy
vehicles that we have in our fleet.

00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:27.867
In the next few years, we're going
to switch the entire fleet over.

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:30.800
And I'm here at UPS because it's
not just the government getting

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.266
in on the action.

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:37.734
Companies like UPS, FedEx,
AT&amp;T, Verizon, and PepsiCo --

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:40.533
firms with some of the largest
fleets in the country --

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:43.133
are switching to more
efficient vehicles.

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:46.467
And through our Clean
Fleets Partnership,

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:48.967
driven not by government,
but by business,

00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:51.200
more companies are going to
be switching to electric and

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.200
alternative vehicles, too --
not out of the goodness of their

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.300
hearts, but because it's
good for their bottom lines.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.700
The goal is simple.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.133
When I was elected
to this office,

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:03.900
America imported 11 million
barrels of oil a day.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.100
Through these and other steps,
by a little more than a decade

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.867
from now, we will have
cut that by one third.

00:03:10.867 --> 00:03:13.433
And by doing so, we're going to
make our economy less vulnerable

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:16.066
to wild swings in oil prices.

00:03:16.066 --> 00:03:18.000
We're going to use cleaner
sources of energy that don't

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.033
imperil our climate.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.633
And we're going to spark new
products and businesses all over

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:28.667
the country by tapping America's
greatest renewable resource: our ingenuity.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.867
We know how important this is.

00:03:30.867 --> 00:03:35.133
This week, we learned that the
economy added 230,000 private

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:37.233
sector jobs last month.

00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:40.900
That makes 1.8 million private
sector jobs created in the last

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.600
13 months.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.066
That's a good sign.

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:45.967
But we have to keep
up the momentum,

00:03:45.967 --> 00:03:50.300
and transitioning to a clean energy
economy will help us do that.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.834
It will ensure that the United
States of America is the home of

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:56.700
the jobs and
industries of tomorrow.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.567
That's how we'll win the future.

00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:01.667
That's how we'll leave our
children an America that's more

00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:05.567
secure and more
prosperous than before.

00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:07.500
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
