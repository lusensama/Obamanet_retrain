00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:08.024
The President:
This week, I traveled
to Afghanistan --

00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:10.491
to thank our troops
serving far from home,

00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:12.825
and to sign a historic
agreement that will help us

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:16.291
complete our mission
and end the war.

00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:19.124
As Commander-in-Chief, nothing
is more humbling or inspiring

00:00:19.124 --> 00:00:21.991
than the chance to spend
some time with our troops.

00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:24.925
At Bagram Air Base, I visited
with some of our outstanding men

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.525
and women in uniform.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:29.124
I thanked them for their
extraordinary service.

00:00:29.124 --> 00:00:33.058
And I let them know that
America honors their sacrifice.

00:00:33.058 --> 00:00:35.792
Because of their
bravery and dedication,

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:39.058
the tide of war has
turned in Afghanistan.

00:00:39.058 --> 00:00:41.491
We've broken the
Taliban's momentum.

00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.858
We've built strong
Afghan Security Forces.

00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:47.525
We've devastated al
Qaeda's leadership.

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:50.391
And one year ago, our troops
launched the operation that

00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:52.591
killed Osama bin Laden.

00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:55.358
The goal that I set --
to defeat al Qaeda,

00:00:55.358 --> 00:00:59.625
and deny it a chance to
rebuild -- is within reach.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:00.958
Because of the
progress we've made,

00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.425
I was able to sign a historic
agreement between the United

00:01:03.425 --> 00:01:06.425
States and Afghanistan
that defines a new kind of

00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:08.558
relationship between
our countries --

00:01:08.558 --> 00:01:11.825
a future in which Afghans are
responsible for the security of

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:15.325
their nation, and we build an
equal partnership between two

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:18.991
sovereign states; a future
in which the war ends,

00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:21.458
and a new chapter begins.

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:24.425
The enormous sacrifices of our
men and women in uniform are

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:25.792
not over.

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:28.525
But many of our troops
are already coming home.

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:32.825
Last year, we removed 10,000
U.S. troops from Afghanistan.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:36.558
Another 23,000 will leave
by the end of the summer.

00:01:36.558 --> 00:01:39.224
As our coalition agreed,
by the end of 2014,

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:42.358
the Afghans will be fully
responsible for the security of

00:01:42.358 --> 00:01:43.892
their country.

00:01:43.892 --> 00:01:45.825
And this is as it should be.

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:48.325
Because after more
than a decade of war,

00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:52.391
it's time to focus on
nation building here at home.

00:01:52.391 --> 00:01:55.425
As a new greatest generation
returns from overseas,

00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:58.258
we must ask ourselves, what
kind of country will they

00:01:58.258 --> 00:01:59.792
come back to?

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:02.124
Will it be a country where a
shrinking number of Americans do

00:02:02.124 --> 00:02:05.591
really well while a growing
number barely get by?

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:08.558
Or will it be a country where
everyone gets a fair shot,

00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:11.792
everyone does their fair share,
and everyone plays by the same

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:16.058
set of rules -- a country with
opportunity worthy of the troops

00:02:16.058 --> 00:02:17.892
who protect us?

00:02:17.892 --> 00:02:20.692
America has answered
this question before.

00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:23.124
My grandfather, a
veteran of Patton's Army,

00:02:23.124 --> 00:02:26.458
got the chance to go to
college on the GI Bill.

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:28.825
My grandmother, who worked
on a bomber assembly line,

00:02:28.825 --> 00:02:30.991
was part of a workforce
that turned out the best

00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:32.758
products on Earth.

00:02:32.758 --> 00:02:36.358
They contributed to a story of
success that every American had

00:02:36.358 --> 00:02:39.458
the chance to share in, the
basic American promise that if

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:42.191
you worked hard, you could do
well enough to raise a family,

00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:45.024
own a home, send
your kids to college,

00:02:45.024 --> 00:02:47.625
and put a little
away for retirement.

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:51.358
Keeping that promise alive is
the defining issue of our time.

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:54.425
But it means making
responsible choices.

00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:56.792
I don't think we should
prioritize things like more tax

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:59.591
cuts for millionaires while
cutting the kinds of investments

00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:02.391
that build a strong
middle class.

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:04.391
That's why I've called on
Congress to take the money we're

00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:07.658
no longer spending at war, use
half of it to pay down our debt,

00:03:07.658 --> 00:03:11.391
and use the other half
to rebuild America.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.725
Because we've got
more jobs to create.

00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:15.058
More students to educate.

00:03:15.058 --> 00:03:17.525
More clean energy to generate.

00:03:17.525 --> 00:03:19.591
More entrepreneurs with
the next great idea,

00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:22.124
just looking for
their shot at success.

00:03:22.124 --> 00:03:24.358
We've got to invest in
things like education and

00:03:24.358 --> 00:03:25.858
medical research.

00:03:25.858 --> 00:03:28.892
We've got to build newer,
faster transportations and

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:30.758
communication networks.

00:03:30.758 --> 00:03:33.991
And we've got to secure the care
and benefits our veterans have

00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:38.291
earned, so that we serve them
as well as they have served us.

00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:41.191
Every time I have the privilege
of meeting with our troops,

00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:44.091
I'm struck by their
courage, their commitment,

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:46.958
their selflessness,
and their teamwork.

00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.091
They have something to teach us.

00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:51.391
Recovering from the worst
economic crisis since the Great

00:03:51.391 --> 00:03:54.325
Depression is a
work in progress --

00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:57.825
but if we follow their example,
then I have no doubt we will

00:03:57.825 --> 00:04:00.191
preserve the promise
of this country,

00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:03.925
protect the freedoms we cherish,
and leave for our children an

00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:06.491
America that's built to last.

00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:08.491
God bless you, and
have a great weekend.
