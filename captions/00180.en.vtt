00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.133
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.834
Today, I want to talk about
something that most of you

00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:11.800
already know --
it's hot outside.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.333
It's really hot.

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.767
And if this feels worse than
normal, that's because it is.

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:20.200
We just found out that July was
the warmest month on record --

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.600
warmer than any other month
since we began keeping track

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.867
more than a century ago.

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:28.200
On top of all this heat, we're
also experiencing one of the

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.066
worst droughts in over 50 years.

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.600
Almost a quarter of the
continental United States is

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.066
facing what we call
"extreme" or "exceptional"

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:40.500
drought -- with states like
Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.367
Oklahoma and Arkansas
getting hit harder than most.

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:46.100
That's bad news for
a lot of people,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.433
but it's especially tough
on our farmers and ranchers.

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:52.433
Right now, almost half of the
corn crop in America is in poor

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:54.467
or very poor condition.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:57.033
Cattlemen are struggling
to feed their animals.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:59.200
Many folks are seeing their
livelihoods dry up in front

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.667
of their eyes.

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:03.734
And if we don't get relief soon,
Americans everywhere will start

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:06.867
to feel the pinch, because the
food our farmers and ranchers

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.700
produce ends up on
grocery store shelves.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.300
We can't let that happen.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.133
That's why, at my direction,
the Department of Agriculture,

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:18.233
led by Secretary Tom Vilsack,
has been working with other

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:20.900
agencies across the federal
government to make sure we're

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.100
doing everything we can to help
farmers and ranchers fight back

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.734
and recover from this disaster.

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:30.567
Already, we've given farmers
and small businesses across 32

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:34.066
states access to
low-interest emergency loans.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.633
We've opened up more
federal land for grazing.

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:38.600
And we're working with crop
insurance companies to give

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.800
farmers a short grace
period on their premiums,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.467
since some families will be
struggling to make ends meet at

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:46.300
the end of the year.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.300
This past week, we
went even further --

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.033
announcing an additional $30
million to help get more water

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:55.734
to livestock and restore
land affected by the drought.

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:57.633
We're making it easier
for even more farmers,

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:00.867
ranchers and businesses
to get emergency loans.

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:03.367
And the Department of
Transportation is helping more

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:06.467
truck drivers deliver
supplies to states that need

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:08.300
them the most.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.500
This is an
all-hands-on-deck response,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.800
and we'll be doing even more
in the coming weeks to help

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.266
families and communities
that are suffering.

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:18.033
But my Administration
can't do it alone.

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:20.633
Congress needs to
do its part, too.

00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:23.300
They need to pass a farm bill
that not only helps farmers and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.433
ranchers respond to
these kinds of disasters,

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:29.233
but also makes necessary
reforms and gives them some

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:31.033
certainty year-round.

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:34.000
That's the single best way we
can help rural communities right

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.567
now, and also in the long-term.

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:39.667
So call your Members of
Congress, write them an email,

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:43.033
and tell them that now is
the time to come together and

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:44.500
get this done.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.967
Too many Americans are suffering
right now to let politics get

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:47.967
in the way.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:51.300
Let's help farmers, ranchers
and business owners recover.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.834
Let's make sure that families
who already stretch their

00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:56.800
budgets to the limit
don't have to pay more for

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.800
groceries this fall.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.767
In the meantime, I'll keep
doing everything I can to help

00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:04.367
communities respond
to this disaster.

00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:06.967
Because at times like these, it
doesn't matter if you live in

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:10.667
Des Moines or Detroit --
we're Americans first.

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:12.133
And if we look out
for each other,

00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:14.500
we'll come out of this
stronger than before.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.834
Have a great weekend,
everybody, and stay cool.
