00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.667
The President:
Over the last month, I've
been traveling the country,

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:11.066
talking to Americans about
how we can out-educate,

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:14.033
out-innovate, and out-build
the rest of the world.

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:16.500
Doing that will require a
government that lives within its

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.900
means, and cuts whatever spending
we can afford to do without.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.567
But it'll also require investing
in our nation's future --

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:26.700
training and
educating our workers;

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.800
increasing our commitment
to research and technology;

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.567
building new roads and bridges,
high-speed rail and high-speed Internet.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.967
In cities and towns
throughout America,

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:39.900
I've seen the benefits
of these investments.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.100
The schools and colleges of
Oregon are providing Intel --

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.133
the state's largest
private employer --

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:49.166
with a steady stream of
highly-educated workers and engineers.

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.900
At Parkville Middle School
outside of Baltimore,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.233
engineering is the
most popular subject,

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:57.533
thanks to outstanding teachers
who are inspiring students to

00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:00.200
focus on their math
and science skills.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.266
In Wisconsin, a company called
Orion is putting hundreds of

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.500
people to work manufacturing
energy-efficient lights in a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.533
once-shuttered plant.

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.467
And in the small
community of Marquette,

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:13.500
in Michigan's Upper Peninsula,
widely accessible high-speed

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.567
Internet has allowed students
and entrepreneurs to connect to

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:18.367
the global economy.

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:20.934
In fact, one small
business, a third-generation,

00:01:20.934 --> 00:01:23.967
family-owned clothing shop
called Getz's is now selling

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:26.834
their products online, which
has helped them to double their

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:31.066
workforce and make them one of
America's 5,000 fastest-growing

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.633
companies in a recent listing.

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:37.600
Each of these places reminds us
that investments in education,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.367
innovation, and infrastructure
are an essential down payment on

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.900
our future.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.333
But they also remind us that the
only way we can afford these

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:48.734
investments is by getting
our fiscal house in order.

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:51.667
Just like any family, we have to
live within our means to make

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:55.133
room for things we
absolutely need.

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:57.734
That's why I've called for
a freeze on annual domestic

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:00.233
spending over the
next five years --

00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:02.300
a freeze that would cut
the deficit by more than

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.233
$400 billion over
the next decade,

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:07.767
bringing this kind of spending
to its lowest share of our

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:11.633
economy since Dwight
Eisenhower was President.

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:14.567
Just to be clear, that's lower
than it was under the past three

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:18.533
administrations, and lower than
it was under Ronald Reagan.

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:22.233
Now, putting this budget freeze in
place will require tough choices.

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:24.367
That's why I've frozen salaries
for hardworking civil servants

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:28.567
for three years, and proposed
cutting programs I care deeply

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:32.734
about, like community action
programs in low-income neighborhoods.

00:02:32.734 --> 00:02:34.500
I'm not taking these
steps lightly --

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.467
but I'm taking them because our
economic future demands it.

00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:42.934
Still, a freeze in annual
domestic spending is just a start.

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:46.500
If we're serious about tackling
our long-run fiscal challenges,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.033
we also need to cut excessive
spending wherever we find it --

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:53.300
in defense spending, spending
in Medicare and Medicaid,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.700
and spending through tax
breaks and loopholes.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.867
I am willing to consider any
serious ideas to help us reduce

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:03.600
the deficit -- no matter
what party is proposing them.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.734
But instead of cutting the
investments in education and

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:07.667
innovation we need to
out-compete the rest of the

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:12.100
world, we need a balanced
approach to deficit reduction.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.133
We all need to be
willing to sacrifice,

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:16.667
but we can't
sacrifice our future.

00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:20.233
Next week, Congress will
focus on a short-term budget.

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:22.633
For the sake of our
people and our economy,

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:25.333
we cannot allow
gridlock to prevail.

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:28.166
Both Democratic and Republican
leaders in the House and Senate

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.233
have said they believe it's
important to keep the government

00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:33.133
running while we work together
on a plan to reduce our

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:35.166
long-term deficit.

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:39.133
Given that, I urge and expect
them to find common ground so we

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:42.934
can accelerate, and not
impede, economic growth.

00:03:42.934 --> 00:03:44.200
It won't be easy.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.500
There will be plenty of
debates and disagreements,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.333
and neither party will
get everything it wants.

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:51.900
Both sides will
have to compromise.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.300
That's what it'll take to do
what's right for our country.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.166
And I look forward to working
with members of both parties to

00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:01.800
produce a responsible budget
that cuts what we can't afford,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.433
sharpens America's competitive
edge in the world,

00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:06.533
and helps us win the future.

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:08.800
Thanks everybody, and
have a great weekend.
