00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:10.577
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.580
Yesterday, we learned that
our businesses created

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.384
another 118,000 new
jobs in September.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:20.720
That makes 67 straight
months of job creation, and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.157
13.2 million new
jobs in all.

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.659
But we would be doing even
better if we didn't have to

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.229
keep dealing with crises in
Congress every few months.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.332
And especially at a time
when the global economy is

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:35.935
softening, our own growth
could slow if Congress

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:39.806
doesn't do away with
harmful austerity measures.

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:42.175
Now, on Wednesday, more
than half of Republicans in

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:44.744
Congress voted to shut down
the government for the

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:47.013
second time in two years.

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:49.048
Fortunately, there were
enough votes in both parties

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:51.351
to pass a last-minute bill
to keep the government open

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:53.420
for another ten weeks.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.322
Unfortunately, that gimmick
only sets up another

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.792
shutdown threat two weeks
before Christmas.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:03.830
Look, that's not the way
America should operate.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.065
It just kicks the can down
the road without solving any

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.067
problems or doing any
long-term planning

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.068
for the future.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:12.205
And that's why I will not
sign another shortsighted,

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:14.274
short-term spending bill
like the one Congress

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:15.608
sent me this week.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:16.609
Here's why.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.314
A few years ago, both
parties agreed to put in

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:24.684
place harmful, automatic
cuts that make no

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:26.686
distinction between
spending we don't need

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.721
and spending we do.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.723
Those cuts have actually
kept our economy from

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.459
growing faster.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.461
Even worse, they're
actually undermining

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:35.462
the middle class.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:36.463
Here's one example.

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:39.432
If we don't undo these
mindless cuts, then next

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:42.302
year, we'll be funding our
kids' education at the same

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:46.473
levels per pupil we did in
the year 2000.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.675
Compared to my budget, that
would be like cutting

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:55.181
federal funding for 4,500
schools, 17,500 teachers and

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:58.184
aides, 1.9 million students.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.888
That's not good for our kids
or our economy.

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:03.990
It's a prescription for
American decline.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.725
And it shouldn't happen.

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:08.127
We should invest in things
like education today, or

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:09.496
we'll pay the
price tomorrow.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.299
Congress should do its job,
stop kicking the can down

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.969
the road, and pass a serious
budget rather than flirt

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.904
with another shutdown.

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:20.840
A serious budget is one that
keeps America strong through

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.810
our military, our law
enforcement; that keeps

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.879
America generous through
caring for our veterans and

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.615
our seniors; that keeps
America competitive by

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.617
educating our kids
and our workers.

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.920
That's what I want to
work with serious people

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.421
in both parties to achieve.

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.891
Because that's how we'll
build on the progress of 13

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.960
million new jobs, and help
the middle class get ahead.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:44.264
Thanks everybody, and have a
great weekend.
