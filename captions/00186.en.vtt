00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:11.194
The President:
Over the last few weeks,
I've been talking a lot about

00:00:11.194 --> 00:00:13.127
America's economic future.

00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:15.994
I've told you how I believe we
should go about creating strong,

00:00:15.994 --> 00:00:17.394
sustained growth.

00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:19.494
How we should pay down
our long-term debt in a

00:00:19.494 --> 00:00:20.994
balanced way.

00:00:20.994 --> 00:00:24.528
And most of all, what we should
do right now to create good,

00:00:24.528 --> 00:00:28.795
middle-class jobs so people
who work hard can get ahead.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:33.594
This isn't some abstract debate
or trivial Washington argument.

00:00:33.594 --> 00:00:36.261
I've said that this is the
defining issue of our time and

00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:37.528
I mean it.

00:00:37.528 --> 00:00:39.594
I've said that this is a
make-or-break moment for the

00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:42.194
middle class and I believe it.

00:00:42.194 --> 00:00:44.828
The decisions we make over the
next few years will have an

00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:48.461
enormous impact on the country
we live in and the one we pass

00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:50.594
on to our children.

00:00:50.594 --> 00:00:53.027
Right now, we're still fighting
our way back from the worst

00:00:53.027 --> 00:00:55.628
economic crisis since
the Great Depression.

00:00:55.628 --> 00:00:59.594
The economy's growing again but
it's not growing fast enough.

00:00:59.594 --> 00:01:03.227
Our businesses have created 4.3
million new jobs over the last

00:01:03.227 --> 00:01:07.294
27 months but we're not
creating them fast enough.

00:01:07.294 --> 00:01:10.094
And we're facing some
pretty serious headwinds --

00:01:10.094 --> 00:01:13.461
the effects of the recent spike
in gas prices to the financial

00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:15.361
crisis in Europe.

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:19.194
But here's the thing: We have
the answers to these problems.

00:01:19.194 --> 00:01:21.928
We have plenty of big ideas and
technical solutions from both

00:01:21.928 --> 00:01:23.528
sides of the aisle.

00:01:23.528 --> 00:01:25.661
That's not what's
holding us back.

00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:29.594
What's holding us back is
a stalemate in Washington.

00:01:29.594 --> 00:01:32.661
Last September, I sent Congress
a jobs bill full of the kinds of

00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:35.961
bipartisan ideas that could put
over a million Americans back to

00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:40.194
work and help bolster our
economy against outside shocks.

00:01:40.194 --> 00:01:42.594
I sent them a plan that
would've reduced our deficit by

00:01:42.594 --> 00:01:46.594
$4 trillion in a balanced way
that pays for the investments we

00:01:46.594 --> 00:01:50.094
need by cutting unnecessary
spending and by asking the

00:01:50.094 --> 00:01:53.728
wealthiest Americans to pay
a little bit more in taxes.

00:01:53.728 --> 00:01:57.027
Since then, Congress has passed
a few parts of that jobs bill --

00:01:57.027 --> 00:02:00.094
like a tax cut that's allowing
working Americans to keep more

00:02:00.094 --> 00:02:03.227
of your paycheck every week --
but on most of the ideas that

00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:05.328
would create jobs
and grow our economy,

00:02:05.328 --> 00:02:08.561
Republicans in Congress
have not lifted a finger.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.661
They'd rather wait until after
the election in November.

00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:14.127
Just this past week,
one of them said,

00:02:14.127 --> 00:02:17.094
"Why not wait for
the reinforcements?"

00:02:17.094 --> 00:02:18.394
That's a quote.

00:02:18.394 --> 00:02:20.494
And you can bet plenty of
his colleagues are thinking

00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:22.528
the same thing.

00:02:22.528 --> 00:02:24.227
I think that's wrong.

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:27.227
This isn't about who wins
or loses in Washington.

00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:30.294
This is about your jobs and
your paychecks and your

00:02:30.294 --> 00:02:31.895
children's future.

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:35.428
There is no excuse for Congress
to stand by and do nothing while

00:02:35.428 --> 00:02:38.194
so many families are struggling.

00:02:38.194 --> 00:02:40.127
No reason whatsoever.

00:02:40.127 --> 00:02:43.094
And right now, Congress should
pass a bill to help states put

00:02:43.094 --> 00:02:45.961
thousands of teachers and
firefighters and police officers

00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:47.594
back on the job.

00:02:47.594 --> 00:02:50.127
They should've passed a bill a
long time ago to put thousands

00:02:50.127 --> 00:02:53.127
of construction workers back to
work rebuilding our roads and

00:02:53.127 --> 00:02:54.795
bridges and runways.

00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:56.695
And instead of just talking
about job creators,

00:02:56.695 --> 00:02:59.728
they should give small business
owners a tax break for hiring

00:02:59.728 --> 00:03:03.161
more workers and paying
them higher wages.

00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:05.961
Right now, Congress should give
every responsible homeowner the

00:03:05.961 --> 00:03:09.928
opportunity to save an average
of $3,000 a year by refinancing

00:03:09.928 --> 00:03:11.294
their mortgage.

00:03:11.294 --> 00:03:14.428
They should extend tax credits
for clean energy manufacturers

00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:17.961
so we don't walk away
from 40,000 good jobs.

00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:20.928
And instead of giving tax breaks
to companies who ship jobs

00:03:20.928 --> 00:03:24.127
overseas, Congress should take
that money and use it to cover

00:03:24.127 --> 00:03:27.294
moving expenses for companies
that are bringing jobs back

00:03:27.294 --> 00:03:28.961
to America.

00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:31.528
There is no reason to wait.

00:03:31.528 --> 00:03:34.094
So you see, every problem
we face is within our power

00:03:34.094 --> 00:03:35.661
to solve.

00:03:35.661 --> 00:03:38.461
What's lacking is our politics.

00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:40.928
I need you to remind your
Members of Congress why you sent

00:03:40.928 --> 00:03:43.561
them to Washington
in the first place.

00:03:43.561 --> 00:03:45.961
Tell them to stop worrying about
the next election and start

00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:48.561
worrying about the
next generation.

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.328
I'm ready to work
with anyone --

00:03:50.328 --> 00:03:52.895
Republican, Democrat
or Independent --

00:03:52.895 --> 00:03:55.494
who is serious about moving
this country forward.

00:03:55.494 --> 00:03:58.861
And I hope Members of
Congress will join me.

00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:00.828
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
