00:00:11.836 --> 00:00:13.338
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:13.338 --> 00:00:14.972
Over the past year,
more than 10 million

00:00:14.972 --> 00:00:17.108
Americans have gained
the financial security

00:00:17.108 --> 00:00:20.545
and peace of mind that comes
with health insurance.

00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:23.014
More than seven million
people enrolled in affordable

00:00:23.014 --> 00:00:25.883
coverage by visiting
HealthCare.gov, or going

00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:28.286
to the marketplace
in their state.

00:00:28.286 --> 00:00:31.656
On average, they're paying
just $82 a month for coverage.

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:34.525
For a lot of people, that's less
than a cell phone bill

00:00:34.525 --> 00:00:36.394
or a cable bill.

00:00:36.394 --> 00:00:38.563
Insurance companies can no
longer deny you coverage

00:00:38.563 --> 00:00:41.232
just because you have a
preexisting condition,

00:00:41.232 --> 00:00:43.901
and they now have to cover
free preventive care like

00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:46.504
checkups and mammograms.

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:49.407
If you missed your chance
to get covered last year,

00:00:49.407 --> 00:00:50.775
here's the good news.

00:00:50.775 --> 00:00:55.012
Starting November 15th,
today, you can go online

00:00:55.012 --> 00:01:02.461
or call 1-800-318-2596
and get covered for 2015.

00:01:03.187 --> 00:01:05.990
And we've spent the last
year improving and upgrading

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.827
HealthCare.gov, to make it
faster and easier to use.

00:01:09.827 --> 00:01:13.231
If you already buy insurance
through the online marketplace,

00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:15.767
now is the time to take a
look at some new options

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:17.201
for next year.

00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:19.203
You might be able
to save more money,

00:01:19.203 --> 00:01:21.439
or find a plan that fits
your family's needs

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.709
even better than the one
you've got now.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.512
If you haven't signed
up for insurance yet,

00:01:27.512 --> 00:01:29.347
this is your chance.

00:01:29.347 --> 00:01:31.916
Odds are, you'll
qualify for tax credits

00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:33.985
to help you afford it.

00:01:33.985 --> 00:01:36.454
But this window won't
stay open forever.

00:01:36.454 --> 00:01:38.823
You only have three
months to shop for plans,

00:01:38.823 --> 00:01:41.325
so it's worth
starting right away.

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:43.294
And it might make a big
difference for your

00:01:43.294 --> 00:01:44.762
family's bottom line.

00:01:44.762 --> 00:01:47.598
Last year, I got an email from
a woman named Amy Williams,

00:01:47.598 --> 00:01:49.333
in Augusta, Georgia.

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.335
She and her husband
are self-employed

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:52.437
in the trucking business.

00:01:52.437 --> 00:01:55.373
For years, they
paid about $1,200

00:01:55.373 --> 00:01:57.375
a month for their
health insurance.

00:01:57.375 --> 00:01:59.644
Then they checked
out HealthCare.gov.

00:01:59.644 --> 00:02:01.813
They found a plan with
coverage they liked,

00:02:01.813 --> 00:02:04.048
and it was way
less expensive.

00:02:04.048 --> 00:02:06.584
She says that they've
saved around $13,000

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:09.887
on their premiums
this year alone.

00:02:09.887 --> 00:02:11.956
Stories like Amy's
are why we fought

00:02:11.956 --> 00:02:14.525
so hard to pass the
Affordable Care Act.

00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:17.395
To help more families
breathe a little easier.

00:02:17.395 --> 00:02:19.397
In part because
this law is working,

00:02:19.397 --> 00:02:21.999
health care prices have
grown at their slowest rate

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.235
in nearly 50 years.

00:02:24.235 --> 00:02:26.671
And this year, insurance
premiums for families who are

00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:29.907
covered through an employer
grew at a rate tied for

00:02:29.907 --> 00:02:31.809
the lowest on record.

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:33.377
So spread the word.

00:02:33.377 --> 00:02:36.214
Tell your friends and family
members to get covered.

00:02:36.214 --> 00:02:39.083
Talk to folks in your
church or your classroom.

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:43.621
Tell them to take a few minutes
to check out Healthcare.gov,

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:51.829
CuidadoDeSalud.gov, or
call 1-800-318-2596 -

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.798
it can make a big
difference in their lives.

00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:56.400
Let them know that it's
easy, it's affordable,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.970
and that they have just three
months, starting today,

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.106
November 15th,
to sign up.

00:03:02.106 --> 00:03:03.808
Together, we can make
sure that even more

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:07.445
of America gets covered
in the year ahead.

00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:08.946
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
