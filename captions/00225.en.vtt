00:00:08.728 --> 00:00:11.428
The President:
At the end of September,
if Congress doesn't act,

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:14.261
funding for our roads
and bridges will expire.

00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:17.795
This would put a stop to highway
construction, bridge repair,

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:20.494
mass transit systems and other
important projects that keep our

00:00:20.494 --> 00:00:23.328
country moving
quickly and safely.

00:00:23.328 --> 00:00:25.828
And it would affect thousands of
construction workers and their

00:00:25.828 --> 00:00:28.994
families who depend on the jobs
created by these projects to

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:30.828
make ends meet.

00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:33.361
Now, usually renewing this
transportation bill is

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:34.828
a no-brainer.

00:00:34.828 --> 00:00:37.394
In fact, Congress has renewed it
seven times over the last two

00:00:37.394 --> 00:00:41.227
years, but thanks to political
posturing in Washington,

00:00:41.227 --> 00:00:44.494
they haven't been able to extend
it this time and the clock's

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:46.127
running out.

00:00:46.127 --> 00:00:48.928
Allowing this bill to expire
would be a disaster for our

00:00:48.928 --> 00:00:51.795
infrastructure and our economy.

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:56.227
Right away, over 4,000 workers
would be furloughed without pay.

00:00:56.227 --> 00:00:58.294
If it's delayed
for just 10 days,

00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:01.461
we will lose nearly $1 billion
in highway funding that we can

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.528
never get back.

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:06.261
And if we wait even longer,
almost one million workers could

00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:09.728
be in danger of losing their
jobs over the next year.

00:01:09.728 --> 00:01:12.661
These are serious consequences
and the pain will be felt all

00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:14.528
across the country.

00:01:14.528 --> 00:01:18.061
In Virginia, 19,000 jobs
are at risk; in Minnesota,

00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:20.461
more than 12,000;
and in Florida,

00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:25.361
over 35,000 people could be out
of work if Congress doesn't act.

00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:28.861
That makes no sense and
it's completely avoidable.

00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:31.628
There's no reason to put more
jobs at risk in an industry that

00:01:31.628 --> 00:01:34.561
has been one of the hardest
hit in this recession.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.795
There's no reason to cut off
funding for transportation

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:40.594
projects at a time when so many
of our roads are congested,

00:01:40.594 --> 00:01:43.561
so many of our bridges are in
need of repair and so many

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:46.795
businesses are feeling
the cost of delays.

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:49.428
This isn't a Democratic
or a Republican issue.

00:01:49.428 --> 00:01:51.127
It's an American issue.

00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:53.227
That's why, last week, I was
joined at the White House by

00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:57.428
representatives from the AFL-CIO
and the Chamber of Commerce --

00:01:57.428 --> 00:01:59.361
two groups who don't
see eye to eye on much,

00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:01.628
but who agree that it's
critically important for our

00:02:01.628 --> 00:02:04.461
economy that Congress act now.

00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:07.328
That's also why 128
mayors, from both parties,

00:02:07.328 --> 00:02:10.361
wrote to Congress asking them
to come together and pass a

00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:12.227
clean extension.

00:02:12.227 --> 00:02:15.361
These are local leaders who are
on the ground every day and who

00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:17.628
know what would happen to
their communities if Congress

00:02:17.628 --> 00:02:19.461
fails to act.

00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:22.394
So I'm calling on Congress,
as soon as they get back,

00:02:22.394 --> 00:02:25.928
to pass a clean extension of
the transportation bill to keep

00:02:25.928 --> 00:02:29.594
workers on the job, keep
critical projects moving forward

00:02:29.594 --> 00:02:32.828
and to give folks a
sense of security.

00:02:32.828 --> 00:02:34.494
There's a lot of talk in
Washington these days about

00:02:34.494 --> 00:02:38.094
creating jobs, but it doesn't
help when those same folks turn

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:41.227
around and risk losing hundreds
of thousands of jobs just

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:43.961
because of political
gamesmanship.

00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:46.561
We need to pass this
transportation bill and put

00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:49.561
people to work
rebuilding America.

00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:52.061
We need to put our differences
aside and do the right thing for

00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:53.661
our economy.

00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:55.561
And now is the time to act.
