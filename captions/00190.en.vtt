00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:06.967
The President:
For the past three
and a half years,

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:10.533
we've been fighting our way back
from a historic economic crisis

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.500
-- one caused by breathtaking
irresponsibility on the part of

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.000
some on Wall Street who treated
our financial system like

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.600
a casino.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.166
Not only did that behavior
nearly destroy the financial

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.900
system; it cost our
economy millions of jobs,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.333
hurt middle-class families and
left taxpayers holding the bag.

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.133
Since then, we've recovered
taxpayer dollars that were used

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.133
to stabilize troubled banks.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.967
And we've put in place Wall
Street reform with smarter,

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:41.033
tougher, common sense rules that
serve one primary purpose --

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:44.967
to prevent a crisis like that
from ever happening again.

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:48.667
And yet, for the past two years,
too many Republicans in Congress

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:52.600
and an army of financial
industry lobbyists actually have

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.934
been waging an all-out
battle to delay,

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:59.100
de-fund and dismantle
Wall Street reform.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.100
Recently, we've seen why
we can't let that happen.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.467
We found out that a big mistake
at one of our biggest banks

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:08.233
resulted in a $2 billion loss.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:11.300
While that bank can handle
a loss of that size,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.900
other banks may not
have been able to.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.734
And without Wall Street reform,
we could've found ourselves with

00:01:16.734 --> 00:01:21.667
the taxpayers once again on the
hook for Wall Street's mistakes.

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:24.800
That's why it's so important
that members of Congress stand

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.734
on the side of reform
-- not against it.

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:30.300
Because we can't afford to
go back to an era of weak

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.700
regulation and
little oversight --

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.300
where excessive risk-taking on
Wall Street and a lack of basic

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.300
oversight in Washington
nearly destroyed our economy.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.433
We can't afford to go back to
that brand of "you're on your

00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:45.400
own" economics -- not after the
American people have worked so

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.233
hard to come back
from this crisis.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.166
We've got to keep
moving forward.

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:53.300
We've got to finish the job of
implementing this reform and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.500
putting these rules in place.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.233
These new rules say that if
you're a big bank or financial

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:01.667
institution, you now have
to hold more cash on hand so

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:04.500
that if you make a bad
decision, you pay for it --

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.266
not the taxpayers.

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:09.200
You have to write out a living
will that details how you'll be

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.467
winding down if you do fail.

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:15.333
The new law takes away big
bonuses and paydays from failed

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:20.166
CEOs while giving shareholders
a say on executive salaries.

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.300
And for the first time
in our nation's history,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.033
we have in place a consumer
watchdog whose sole job is to

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:29.567
look out for working families by
protecting them from deceptive

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:31.767
and unfair practices.

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:34.700
So unless you run a financial
institution whose business model

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.200
is built on cheating consumers
or making risky bets that could

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.333
damage the whole economy, you
have nothing to fear from Wall

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:43.200
Street reform.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.333
Yes, it discourages big banks
and financial institutions from

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.500
making risky bets with
taxpayer-insured money.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.600
And it encourages them to do
things that actually help the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.700
economy, like extending loans to
entrepreneurs with good ideas;

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.200
to middle-class families
who want to buy a home;

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.233
to students who want to
pursue a higher education.

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:05.934
That's what Wall Street
reform is all about --

00:03:05.934 --> 00:03:08.867
making this economy
stronger for you.

00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:12.266
And we're going to keep working
to recover every job loss to the

00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:15.066
recession; to build an
economy where hard work and

00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:17.567
responsibility are
once again rewarded;

00:03:17.567 --> 00:03:20.900
to restore an America where
everyone has a fair shot,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.900
everyone does their fair
share, and everybody plays by

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.533
the same rules.

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:27.767
I believe the free market is
one of the greatest forces for

00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:31.100
progress in human history; that
businesses are the engine of

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.633
growth; that risk-takers and the
innovators should be celebrated.

00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:37.567
But I also believe
that at its best,

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:40.667
the free market has never been
a license to take whatever you

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:42.834
want however you can get it.

00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:46.734
Alongside our entrepreneurial
spirit and rugged individualism,

00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:49.934
America only prospers when we
meet our obligations to one

00:03:49.934 --> 00:03:53.600
another and to
future generations.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.934
If you agree with me, let
your Member of Congress know.

00:03:56.934 --> 00:03:59.667
Tell them to spend less time
working to undermine rules that

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:02.967
are there to protect the economy
and spend more time actually

00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:05.734
working to strengthen
the economy.

00:04:05.734 --> 00:04:07.734
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
