The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.000
This week, I called
members of my Cabinet

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.934
to the White House to deal
with a challenge that

00:00:15.934 --> 00:00:19.033
affects so many families
and communities -

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:22.300
the crime, the outrage,
of sexual violence.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.133
Sexual assault is an
affront

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:28.166
to our basic decency and humanity.

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:31.233
And it's about all of us
- the safety of those we

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:35.133
love most: our moms, our
wives,

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.133
our daughters and our sons.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.600
Because when a child
starts to question their

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.467
self-worth after being
abused,

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:45.033
and maybe starts withdrawing...

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:46.600
or a young woman drops
out of school

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.033
after being attacked...

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:49.800
or a mother struggles
to hold down

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.233
a job and support her kids
after an assault...

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:54.900
it's not just these
individuals

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.100
and their families who suffer.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.500
Our communities - our
whole country -

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.567
is held back.

00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:02.734
Over the past five years,
we've stepped

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:04.800
up our efforts stop these crimes.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.233
And this week, we took
another important

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:09.700
step to protect young
women at college.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.567
An estimated 1 in 5 women
is sexually assaulted

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:15.166
at college - and that's
totally unacceptable.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.166
So I've created the
White House Task Force

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.934
to Protect Students
from Sexual Assault.

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:21.567
We're going to help
schools do a better

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:24.367
job of preventing and responding
to sexual assault

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:26.033
on their campuses.

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:28.033
Because college should be
a place where our young

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:30.567
people feel secure and
confident,

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:32.867
so they can go as far as their
talents will take them.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:35.033
And we're going to keep
working

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:37.800
to stop sexual assaults wherever
they occur.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.333
We'll keep strengthening
our criminal justice

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.233
system, so police and
prosecutors

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:44.600
have the tools and training to
prevent these crimes and bring

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.533
perpetrators to justice.

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.100
We'll keep reaching out
to survivors, to make sure

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.233
they're getting all the
support they need to heal.

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:53.834
We're going to keep
combating sexual assault

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:56.266
in our armed forces,
because when a member

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.834
of our military is attacked
by the very people

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:02.467
he or she trusts and serves
with, that's an injustice

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:04.200
that no one who volunteers
to protect

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.767
our nation should ever endure.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.233
Some of this is a
job for government.

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:11.967
But really, it's
up to all of us.

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:14.800
We've got to teach young
people - men and women -

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.734
to be brave enough to
stand up

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:19.900
and help put an end to these crimes.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.767
We've especially got to
teach young men

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:24.867
to show women the respect
they deserve.

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:26.400
I want every young man in
America

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.767
to know that real men don't hurt women.

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:31.700
And those of us who are
fathers have a special

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.100
obligation to make sure
every young man out there

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.967
understands that being
a man means recognizing

00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:40.567
sexual violence and being
outraged by it, and doing

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:41.667
their part to stop it.

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:45.333
Perhaps most important,
we need to keep saying

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:46.633
to anyone out there who has

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:50.300
ever been assaulted: you are not alone.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.967
We have your back.

00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:52.967
I've got your back.

00:02:52.967 --> 00:02:55.133
I'm going to keep pushing
for others

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:58.000
to step up - across my
administration, in Congress,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.166
in state capitals, college
campuses and military bases

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:03.200
all across our country.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.967
This is a priority for me,
not only as President

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:09.767
and Commander-in-Chief, but as
a husband and a father

00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:11.066
of two extraordinary girls.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:14.100
And I hope it's a
priority for you.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.266
Because here in the United
States of America,

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:19.367
every man and woman, every girl
and boy,

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:22.967
has the right to be safe and
protected and to pursue

00:03:22.967 --> 00:03:24.433
their own piece of the American dream.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.333
Let's all do our part
to make it happen.

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:29.967
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
