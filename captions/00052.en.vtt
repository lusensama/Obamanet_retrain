00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.978
The President: This week,
together with our allies

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:13.947
and partners, partners,
we reached an historic

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:17.317
understanding with Iran,
which, if fully implemented,

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:20.286
will prevent it from obtaining
a nuclear weapon and make

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:24.157
our country, our allies,
and our world safer.

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.159
This framework is
the result of tough,

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.894
principled diplomacy.

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:30.330
It's a good deal -- a
deal that meets our core

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.766
objectives, including
strict limitations

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.202
on Iran's program and cutting
off every pathway that

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:40.106
Iran could take to
develop a nuclear weapon.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:42.275
This deal denies Iran
the plutonium necessary

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:43.676
to build a bomb.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.279
It shuts down Iran's
path to a bomb using

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:47.981
enriched uranium.

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:50.016
Iran has agreed that
it will not stockpile

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:52.652
the materials needed
to build a weapon.

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:54.954
Moreover, international
inspectors will have

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.557
unprecedented access to
Iran's nuclear program

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.593
because Iran will face
more inspections than

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:02.128
any other country
in the world.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:05.965
If Iran cheats, the
world will know it.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.834
If we see something
suspicious,

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.669
we will inspect it.

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.605
So this deal is not based
on trust, it's based

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:14.674
on unprecedented
verification.

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:18.912
And this is a long-term
deal, with strict limits

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.514
on Iran's program for
more than a decade and

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:24.317
unprecedented transparency
measures that will last

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:26.753
for 20 years or more.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.888
And as a member of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:31.925
Treaty, Iran will never
be permitted to develop

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.093
a nuclear weapon.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:36.396
In return for Iran's
actions, the international

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:38.631
community, including the
United States, has agreed

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.000
to provide Iran with
phased relief from

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.135
certain sanctions.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.838
If Iran violates
the deal, sanctions

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:47.273
can be snapped
back into place.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.542
Meanwhile, other
American sanctions

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:52.178
on Iran for its support of
terrorism, its human rights

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:55.949
abuses, its ballistic missile
program, all will continue

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.550
to be enforced.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.886
As I said this week, many
key details will need

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:02.021
to be finalized over
the next three months,

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:05.024
and nothing is agreed to
until everything is agreed.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.026
And if there is
backsliding, there

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:08.895
will be no deal.

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:12.065
Here in the United States,
I expect a robust debate.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.100
We'll keep Congress and
the American people fully

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.203
briefed on the
substance of the deal.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:20.573
As we engage in this
debate, let's remember-we

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.642
really only have three
options for dealing with

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:25.879
Iran's nuclear program:
bombing Iran's nuclear

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.214
facilities-which will
only set its program back

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:30.216
a few years-while starting
another war in the

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:33.486
Middle East; abandoning
negotiations and hoping

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.722
for the best with
sanctions-even though

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:38.124
that's always led to Iran
making more progress

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:42.428
in its nuclear program; or
a robust and verifiable

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:45.164
deal like this one that
peacefully prevents Iran

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:48.167
from obtaining a
nuclear weapon.

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:51.237
As President and Commander
in Chief, I firmly believe

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.940
that the diplomatic
option-a comprehensive,

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.076
long-term deal like
this-is by far the

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:58.444
best option.

00:02:58.444 --> 00:02:59.445
For the United States.

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:00.847
For our allies.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.216
And for the world.

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:06.853
Our work -- this deal
-- is not yet done.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:09.455
Diplomacy is
painstaking work.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.991
Success is not
guaranteed.

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:14.027
But today we have an
historic opportunity

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.496
to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons in Iran,

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:19.465
and to do so peacefully,
with the international

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.668
community firmly
behind us.

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:23.670
And this will be our work
in the days and months

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.139
ahead in keeping with
the best traditions of

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.140
American leadership.
