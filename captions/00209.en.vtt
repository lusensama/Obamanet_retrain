The President:
Happy New Year, everybody.

00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:12.994
This week, I traveled
to Cleveland, Ohio,

00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:15.594
to talk with folks about the
biggest challenge we face as a

00:00:15.594 --> 00:00:18.961
country -- rebuilding our
economy so that, once again,

00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:22.194
hard work pays off,
responsibility is rewarded,

00:00:22.194 --> 00:00:25.061
and anyone, regardless of who
they are or where they come

00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:27.795
from, can make it if they try.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:30.261
That's the economy
America deserves.

00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:33.561
That's the economy I'm
fighting every day to build.

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:36.227
Now, to get there, the most
important thing we need to do is

00:00:36.227 --> 00:00:38.628
to get more Americans
back to work.

00:00:38.628 --> 00:00:42.161
And over the past three years,
we've made steady progress.

00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:46.127
We just learned that our economy
added 212,000 private sector

00:00:46.127 --> 00:00:47.895
jobs in December.

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:50.594
After losing more than 8
million jobs in the recession,

00:00:50.594 --> 00:00:54.227
we've added more than 3 million
private sector jobs over the

00:00:54.227 --> 00:00:56.461
past 22 months.

00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:59.895
And we're starting 2012 with
manufacturing on the rise and

00:00:59.895 --> 00:01:03.094
the American auto
industry on the mend.

00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:04.994
We're heading in
the right direction.

00:01:04.994 --> 00:01:06.494
And we're not going to let up.

00:01:06.494 --> 00:01:09.227
On Wednesday the White House
will host a forum called

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:11.394
"Insourcing American Jobs."

00:01:11.394 --> 00:01:15.194
We'll hear from business leaders
who are bringing jobs back home

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:19.027
and see how we can help other
businesses follow their lead.

00:01:19.027 --> 00:01:22.127
Because this is a make or break
moment for the middle class and

00:01:22.127 --> 00:01:24.027
all those working to get there.

00:01:24.027 --> 00:01:25.061
We've got to keep at it.

00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:26.494
We've got to keep creating jobs.

00:01:26.494 --> 00:01:29.728
And we've got to keep rebuilding
our economy so that everyone

00:01:29.728 --> 00:01:32.728
gets a fair shot, everyone
does their fair share --

00:01:32.728 --> 00:01:35.027
and everyone plays
by the same rules.

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:37.795
We can't go back to the days
when the financial system was

00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:40.728
stacking the deck against
ordinary Americans.

00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:42.428
To me, that's not an option.

00:01:42.428 --> 00:01:44.695
Not after everything
we've been through.

00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:47.861
That's why I appointed Richard
Cordray as our nation's new

00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:50.494
consumer watchdog this week.

00:01:50.494 --> 00:01:53.728
Richard's job is simple:
to look out for you.

00:01:53.728 --> 00:01:56.494
Every day, his sole mission
is to protect consumers from

00:01:56.494 --> 00:01:59.428
potential abuses by the
financial industry and to make

00:01:59.428 --> 00:02:02.795
sure that you've got all the
transparent information you need

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:06.328
to make the important financial
decisions in your lives.

00:02:06.328 --> 00:02:09.127
I nominated Richard for
this job last summer.

00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:11.261
And yet, Republicans in the
Senate kept blocking his

00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:14.194
confirmation -- not because
they objected to him,

00:02:14.194 --> 00:02:17.294
but because they wanted
to weaken his agency.

00:02:17.294 --> 00:02:18.828
That made no sense.

00:02:18.828 --> 00:02:22.161
Every day we waited was a day
you and consumers all across the

00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:25.227
country were at
greater financial risk.

00:02:25.227 --> 00:02:28.027
So this year, I'm going to keep
doing whatever it takes to move

00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:31.361
this economy forward and to make
sure that middle class families

00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:34.528
regain the security they've
lost over the past decade.

00:02:34.528 --> 00:02:37.561
That's my New Year's
resolution to all of you.

00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:39.094
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
