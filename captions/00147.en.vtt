00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:12.994
The President:
On Monday, an act of terror
wounded dozens and killed three

00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:15.828
innocent people at
the Boston Marathon.

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:19.061
But in the days since, the
world has witnessed one sure and

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:23.695
steadfast truth: Americans
refuse to be terrorized.

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:26.828
Ultimately, that's what we'll
remember from this week.

00:00:26.828 --> 00:00:28.661
That's what will remain.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:33.094
Stories of heroism and kindness;
resolve and resilience;

00:00:33.094 --> 00:00:35.961
generosity and love.

00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:38.561
The brave first responders
-- police officers and

00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:41.661
firefighters, EMTs,
and National Guard --

00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:45.227
who ran toward danger to
help their fellow citizens.

00:00:45.227 --> 00:00:48.861
The race volunteers, spectators,
and exhausted runners who rushed

00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:52.227
to help, including troops and
veterans who never expected to

00:00:52.227 --> 00:00:54.994
see such scenes on the
streets of America.

00:00:54.994 --> 00:00:57.428
The determined doctors and
nurses at some of the world's

00:00:57.428 --> 00:01:01.094
best hospitals, who've toiled
day and night to save so

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:02.895
many lives.

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:05.561
The big-hearted
people of Boston --

00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:08.661
residents, priests,
shopkeepers --

00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:10.594
who carried victims
in their arms;

00:01:10.594 --> 00:01:14.961
delivered water and blankets;
lined up to give blood;

00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:18.127
opened their homes up
to total strangers.

00:01:18.127 --> 00:01:21.227
And the heroic federal agents
and police officers who worked

00:01:21.227 --> 00:01:23.661
together throughout the
week, often at great risk to

00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:27.127
themselves, to keep
our communities safe.

00:01:27.127 --> 00:01:29.994
As a country, we are eternally
grateful for the profound

00:01:29.994 --> 00:01:33.061
sacrifices they make
in the line of duty --

00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:36.161
sometimes making the ultimate
sacrifice to defend the people

00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:38.494
they've sworn to protect.

00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:42.795
If anyone wants to know who
we are; what America is;

00:01:42.795 --> 00:01:47.127
how we respond to evil
and terror -- that's it.

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:48.127
Selflessly.

00:01:48.127 --> 00:01:49.194
Compassionately.

00:01:49.194 --> 00:01:51.328
And unafraid.

00:01:51.328 --> 00:01:54.594
Through days that would test
even the sturdiest of souls,

00:01:54.594 --> 00:01:57.461
Boston's spirit
remains undaunted.

00:01:57.461 --> 00:02:00.394
America's spirit
remains undimmed.

00:02:00.394 --> 00:02:03.928
Our faith in each other,
our love for this country,

00:02:03.928 --> 00:02:06.628
our common creed that cuts
across whatever superficial

00:02:06.628 --> 00:02:10.461
differences we may have --
that's what makes us strong.

00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:12.394
That's why we endure.

00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:15.761
In the days to come, we will
remain vigilant as a nation.

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:18.394
And I have no doubt the city
of Boston and its surrounding

00:02:18.394 --> 00:02:21.795
communities will continue to
respond in the same proud and

00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:24.728
heroic way that they
have thus far --

00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:27.661
and their fellow Americans will
be right there with them every

00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:29.428
step of the way.

00:02:29.428 --> 00:02:32.227
May God bless the people of
Boston and the United States

00:02:32.227 --> 00:02:33.227
of America.
