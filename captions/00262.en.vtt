00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.533
President Obama:
Today, I'd like to speak to
you about an issue that is

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.867
fundamental to America's
national security: the need

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:14.667
for the Senate to approve the
New START Treaty this year.

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:17.533
This Treaty is rooted in a
practice that dates back

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.166
to Ronald Reagan.

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:23.066
The idea is simple - as the two
nations with over 90 percent of

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:26.667
the world's nuclear weapons, the
United States and Russia have a

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:30.900
responsibility to work together
to reduce our arsenals.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.000
And to ensure that our national
security is protected,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.400
the United States has an
interest in tracking Russia's

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.633
nuclear arsenal through a
verification effort that puts

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:42.133
U.S. inspectors on the ground.

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.834
As President Reagan said when
he signed a nuclear arms treaty

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:49.867
with the Soviet Union in
1987, "Trust, but verify."

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:53.066
That is precisely what
the new START Treaty does.

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.800
After nearly a full
year of negotiations,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.800
we completed an agreement
earlier this year that cuts by a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.600
third the number of long-range
nuclear weapons and delivery

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.500
vehicles that the United
States and Russia can deploy,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.133
while ensuring that America
retains a strong nuclear

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.633
deterrent, and can put
inspectors back on the

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:12.333
ground in Russia.

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.667
The Treaty also helped us
reset our relations with Russia,

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:17.633
which leads to concrete benefits.

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:20.467
For instance, Russia has been
indispensable to our efforts

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:23.000
to enforce strong
sanctions on Iran,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.066
to secure loose nuclear
materials from terrorists,

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:29.266
and to equip our
troops in Afghanistan.

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:32.800
All of this will be put at risk
if the Senate does not pass the

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.467
New START Treaty.

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:37.333
Without ratification this year,
the United States will have no

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:40.066
inspectors on the ground,
and no ability to verify

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.000
Russian nuclear activities.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So those who would block this
treaty are breaking President

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.800
Reagan's rule - they want
to trust, but not verify.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.400
Without ratification, we put at
risk the coalition that we have

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.800
built to put pressure on Iran,
and the transit routes through

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.133
Russia that we use to equip
our troops in Afghanistan.

00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:01.800
And without ratification, we
risk undoing decades of American

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.533
leadership on nuclear security,
and decades of bipartisanship

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:07.166
on this issue.

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:11.233
Our security and our position
in the world are at stake.

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:15.066
Indeed, since the Reagan years,
every President has pursued a

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:18.500
negotiated, verified,
arms reduction treaty.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.533
And every time that these
treaties have been reviewed

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:24.533
by the Senate, they have
passed with over 85 votes.

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:27.800
Bipartisan support for new
START could not be stronger.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.200
It has been endorsed by
Republicans from the Reagan

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.333
Administration and both Bush
Administrations - including

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:37.934
Colin Powell, George Shultz,
Jim Baker, and Henry Kissinger.

00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:40.066
And it was approved by the
Senate Foreign Relations

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:44.400
Committee by a strong
bipartisan vote of 14-4.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.867
Over the last several months,
several questions have been

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:51.066
asked about New START, and we
have answered every single one.

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:52.667
Some have asked whether
it will limit our missile

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:54.967
defense - it will not.

00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:58.600
Some, including Senator Jon Kyl,
have asked that we modernize our

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.233
nuclear infrastructure for the
21st century - we are doing so,

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:07.200
and plan to invest at least $85
billion in that effort over the

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.867
next ten years - a
significant increase

00:03:09.867 --> 00:03:12.467
from the Bush Administration.

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:15.467
Finally, some make no argument
against the Treaty - they just

00:03:15.467 --> 00:03:17.467
ask for more time.

00:03:17.467 --> 00:03:20.400
But remember this: it has
already been 11 months since

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.967
we've had inspectors in Russia,
and every day that goes by

00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:27.266
without ratification is a
day that we lose confidence

00:03:27.266 --> 00:03:30.467
in our understanding of
Russia's nuclear weapons.

00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:34.266
If the Senate doesn't act
this year - after six months,

00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:38.400
18 hearings, and nearly a
thousand questions answered -

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.200
it would have to start over
from scratch in January.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.100
The choice is clear: a failure
to ratify new START would be

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.200
a dangerous gamble with
America's national security,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.000
setting back our understanding
of Russia's nuclear weapons,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.533
as well as our
leadership in the world.

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.066
That is not what the
American people sent

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:58.000
us to Washington to do.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.667
There is enough gridlock,
enough bickering.

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:04.066
If there is one issue that
should unite us - as Republicans

00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:07.734
and Democrats - it should
be our national security.

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:10.333
Some things are
bigger than politics.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.700
As Republican Dick Lugar
said the other day,

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.567
"Every Senator has an obligation
in the national security

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:20.100
interest to take a stand,
to do his or her duty."

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.800
Senator Lugar is right.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.734
And if the Senate
passes this treaty,

00:04:23.734 --> 00:04:27.066
it will not be an achievement
for Democrats or Republicans -

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:29.800
it will be a win for America.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.300
Thanks.
