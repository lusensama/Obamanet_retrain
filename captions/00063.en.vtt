00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:11.953
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.953 --> 00:00:13.522
Every day, we get
thousands of letters

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:15.891
and emails at the White
House from Americans across

00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:19.628
the country - and every
night, I read ten of them.

00:00:19.628 --> 00:00:22.230
They tell me about their
hopes and their worries,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.800
their hardships
and successes.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.602
They're the Americans I'm
working for every day -

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:30.105
and this year, several of
these letter writers will

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:32.674
join me at the Capitol
when I deliver my annual

00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:35.644
State of the Union
Address on Tuesday night.

00:00:35.644 --> 00:00:37.612
Carolyn Reed wrote to me
from Colorado to tell

00:00:37.612 --> 00:00:39.815
me she was able to expand
her business, thanks

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:42.918
to a loan from the Small
Business Administration.

00:00:42.918 --> 00:00:45.053
Today, she and her
husband own seven

00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:47.456
Silver Mine Sub Shops
- and last year,

00:00:47.456 --> 00:00:50.358
they raised wages for all
their hourly employees.

00:00:51.493 --> 00:00:54.463
Victor Fugate, from
Butler, Missouri, wrote

00:00:54.463 --> 00:00:56.932
to tell me that he was
unemployed for a while

00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:59.201
a few years ago, but today
he's earned his degree

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:01.403
and found a
full-time job.

00:01:01.403 --> 00:01:03.405
Victor said that he
and his wife were able

00:01:03.405 --> 00:01:05.607
to afford their student
loans because our country

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.609
offered millions of
Americans the chance

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.378
to cap their monthly payments
as a percentage of their

00:01:10.378 --> 00:01:13.281
income - and, because of
the Affordable Care Act,

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:15.283
they now have the security
and peace of mind

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:17.586
of affordable
health insurance.

00:01:17.586 --> 00:01:19.721
While serving in
Afghanistan, Jason Gibson

00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:23.391
was gravely wounded-he
lost both his legs.

00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:25.393
When I first met him in
the hospital, he was

00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:27.395
just beginning his
long, difficult road

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:28.830
to recovery.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.299
But last year, Sergeant
Gibson wrote to tell

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.869
me that with the help of our
extraordinary doctors and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.138
nurses, he's making
extraordinary progress.

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:38.340
He just moved
into a new home,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.878
and he and his wife
just had a baby girl.

00:01:42.878 --> 00:01:44.880
Stories like these give
us reason to start

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.048
the new year
with confidence.

00:01:47.048 --> 00:01:48.917
2014 was the
fastest year for

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:51.353
job growth since
the 1990s.

00:01:51.353 --> 00:01:55.323
Unemployment fell faster
than any year since 1984.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:57.292
Our combat mission in
Afghanistan has come

00:01:57.292 --> 00:01:59.294
to a responsible
end, and more of our

00:01:59.294 --> 00:02:01.062
heroes are
coming home.

00:02:01.062 --> 00:02:04.566
America's
resurgence is real.

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:06.768
Our job now is to make
sure that every American

00:02:06.768 --> 00:02:10.305
feels that they're a part
of our country's comeback.

00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:12.707
That's what I'll focus on
in my State of the Union -

00:02:12.707 --> 00:02:14.776
how to build on our
momentum, with rising

00:02:14.776 --> 00:02:18.346
wages, growing incomes, and
a stronger middle class.

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:20.382
And I'll call on this
new Congress to join

00:02:20.382 --> 00:02:22.884
me in putting aside the
political games and

00:02:22.884 --> 00:02:25.754
finding areas where we
agree so we can deliver

00:02:25.754 --> 00:02:27.522
for the American
people.

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:29.591
The last six years have
demanded resilience and

00:02:29.591 --> 00:02:32.027
sacrifice from
all of us.

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:34.262
All of us have a right to
be proud of the progress

00:02:34.262 --> 00:02:35.263
America has made.

00:02:35.263 --> 00:02:38.433
And I hope you'll tune in
on Tuesday to hear about

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:41.169
the steps we can take to
build on this progress,

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.005
and to seize this
moment together.

00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:46.808
Thanks everybody, and
have a great weekend.
