00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:08.066
The President:
One of the fundamental
challenges of our time is

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.567
building an economy where
everyone gets a fair shot,

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:14.166
everybody does their fair
share, and everybody plays by

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.767
the same set of rules.

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:19.633
And as many Americans rush to
file their taxes this weekend,

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:22.166
it's worth pointing out that
we've got a tax system that

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.967
doesn't always uphold
the principle of everybody

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:26.767
doing their part.

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:29.233
This is not just about fairness.

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:31.033
This is also about growth.

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:33.400
It's about being able to make
the investments we need to

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.500
strengthen our economy
and create jobs.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.934
And it's about whether we as a
country are willing to pay for

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:40.834
those investments.

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:42.934
In a perfect world, of course,
none of us would have to pay

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:44.300
any taxes.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.333
We'd have no
deficits to pay down.

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.333
And we'd have all the resources
we needed to invest in things

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.934
like schools and roads and a
strong military and new sources

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:55.934
of energy -- investments that
have always bolstered our

00:00:55.934 --> 00:00:58.934
economy and strengthened
the middle class.

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:02.233
But we live in the real
world, with real choices and

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:03.900
real consequences.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.100
Right now, we've got
significant deficits to close.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.166
We've got serious investments
to make to keep our

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.700
economy growing.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.934
And we can't afford to keep
spending more money on tax cuts

00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:16.734
for the wealthiest Americans who
don't need them and didn't even

00:01:16.734 --> 00:01:17.934
ask for them.

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:20.967
Warren Buffett is one of
the world's wealthiest men.

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:24.533
But he pays a lower tax
rate than his secretary.

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.633
That's just the way
the system is set up.

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:29.633
In fact, one in four
millionaires pays a lower tax

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:31.233
rate than millions
of hardworking

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:33.300
middle-class households.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.033
As Warren points out, that's not
fair and it doesn't make sense.

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:39.934
It's wrong that middle-class
Americans pay a higher share of

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:44.333
their income in taxes than some
millionaires and billionaires.

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.400
Now, this week, Members of
Congress are going to have a

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.567
chance to set things right.

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:51.533
They get to vote on what
we call the Buffett Rule.

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:55.834
It's simple: If you make more
than $1 million every year,

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:58.600
you should pay at least the same
percentage of your income in

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.066
taxes as middle-class
families do.

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:05.734
On the other hand, if you make
less than $250,000 a year --

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:08.467
like 98% of American
families do --

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:11.000
your taxes shouldn't go up.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.734
That's all there is to it.

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:14.166
It's pretty sensible.

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.500
Most Americans
support this idea.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.266
One survey found that two-thirds
of millionaires do, too.

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:23.367
So do nearly half
of all Republicans.

00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:26.100
We just need some Republican
politicians to get on board with

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.100
where the country is.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.300
I know they'll say that this
is all about wanting to raise

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.900
people's taxes.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.100
They probably won't tell
you that if you belong to a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.867
middle-class family, then I've
cut your taxes each year that

00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:38.700
I've been in office, and I've
cut taxes for small business

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.033
owners 17 times.

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:44.066
But the thing is, for
most Americans like me,

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:48.066
tax rates are near their
lowest point in 50 years.

00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:53.233
In 2001 and 2003, the wealthiest
Americans received two huge

00:02:53.233 --> 00:02:54.967
new tax cuts.

00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:58.867
We were told these tax cuts
would lead to faster job growth.

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:02.500
Instead, we got the slowest
job growth in half a century,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.367
and the typical American family
actually saw its income fall.

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:09.266
On the flip side, when the most
well-off Americans were asked to

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:11.967
pay a little more in the
1990s, we were warned that it

00:03:11.967 --> 00:03:13.600
would kill jobs.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.867
Instead, tens of millions
of jobs followed.

00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:20.066
So we've tried this
trickle-down experiment before.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.533
It doesn't work.

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.967
And middle class families have
seen too much of their security

00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:27.000
eroded over the past few decades
for us to tell them they're

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.133
going to have to do more because
the wealthiest Americans are

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:31.934
going to do less.

00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:34.700
We can't stop investing in the
things that will help grow our

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.767
economy and create jobs --
things like education, research,

00:03:38.767 --> 00:03:41.500
new sources of energy --
just so folks like me can get

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.367
another tax cut.

00:03:43.367 --> 00:03:46.767
So I hope you'll ask your Member
of Congress to step up and echo

00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:50.600
that call this week by
voting for the Buffett Rule.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.300
Remind them that in America,
prosperity has never just

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.600
trickled down from
a wealthy few.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.066
Prosperity has always
been built by a strong,

00:03:58.066 --> 00:04:00.066
thriving middle class.

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:03.367
That's a principle worth
reaffirming right now.

00:04:03.367 --> 00:04:05.633
Thanks, God bless you,
and have a great weekend.
