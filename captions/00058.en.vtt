00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:11.611
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.613
At a moment when our
businesses are creating jobs

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:17.317
at the fastest pace since
the 1990s, we've still got

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.953
to do everything we can to
help workers and businesses

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.722
succeed in the new
economy - one that's

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:26.226
competitive, connected,
and changing every day.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:28.595
One thing we know for
certain about businesses

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.264
in the 21st century is that
they'll need to sell more

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:34.434
goods and services Made
in America to the rest

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.035
of the world.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:38.304
Now, our businesses already
sell goods and services

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.974
in other countries
at record levels.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:43.410
Our farmers, our
factory workers,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.612
and our small businesses
are exporting more

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:48.081
than ever before -
and exporters tend

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.084
to pay their workers
higher wages.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.086
More small businesses
are using the internet

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.455
to grow their business by
reaching new customers

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.657
they couldn't
reach before, too.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.660
As an example, nine in ten
American small businesses

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.596
that use eBay as a platform
to sell their products

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:07.367
are exporters - with customers
in more than 30 different

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.636
countries on average.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.772
But there's a lot
of room for growth.

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:14.941
After all, 95% of the
world's potential

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:17.944
customers live
outside our borders.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:21.047
Many of them live in the
Asia-Pacific - the world's

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:23.316
fastest-growing region.

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:26.352
And as we speak, China
is trying to write

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:30.056
the rules for trade in
the 21st century.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:32.025
That would put our workers
and our businesses

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:34.093
at a massive disadvantage.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:36.229
We can't let that happen.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.631
We should write
those rules.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.633
That's why Congress
should act on something

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:43.269
called "trade
promotion authority."

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.371
This is bipartisan
legislation that would

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.507
protect American workers,
and promote American

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:50.276
businesses, with strong
new trade deals from Asia

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:54.180
to Europe that aren't just
free, but are fair.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.950
It would level the playing
field for American workers.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.053
It would hold all countries
to the same high labor and

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:04.524
environmental standards to
which we hold ourselves.

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:06.693
Now, I'm the first to admit
that past trade deals

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:09.028
haven't always lived
up to the hype.

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:11.064
And that's why we've
successfully gone after

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:14.868
countries that break the rules
at our workers' expense.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:16.870
But that doesn't mean we
should close ourselves

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.372
off from new opportunities,
and sit on the sidelines

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:22.742
while other countries
write our future for us.

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:24.844
We should seize
those opportunities.

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:27.814
We should make sure the
future is written by us.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:30.483
And if we do, we won't
just keep creating good

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:33.453
new jobs for decades to
come - we'll make sure that

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:37.390
this century is another
all-American century.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.459
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
