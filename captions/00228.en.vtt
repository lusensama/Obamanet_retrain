00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:09.233
The President:
On Thursday, I visited a new,
high-tech factory in Michigan

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.400
where workers are helping
America lead the way in a

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.667
growing clean energy industry.

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:16.567
They were proud of their
work, and they should be.

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:18.900
They're not just showing us a
path out of the worst recession

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.700
in generations -- they're
proving that this is still a

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.433
country where we make things;
where new ideas take root and

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:27.867
grow; where the
best universities,

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:31.500
most creative entrepreneurs, and
most dynamic businesses in the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.834
world call home.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.133
They're proving that
even in difficult times,

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.033
there's not a country on
Earth that wouldn't trade

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:40.433
places with us.

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:42.200
That doesn't mean we
don't face some very tough

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.033
economic challenges.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:46.667
Many Americans are
hurting badly right now.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:49.300
Many have been
unemployed for too long.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.533
Putting these men and
women back to work,

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:56.200
and growing wages for everybody,
has got to be our top priority.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.600
But lately, the response from
Washington has been partisanship

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.100
and gridlock that's only
undermined public confidence and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.700
hindered our efforts
to grow the economy.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.667
So while there's nothing
wrong with our country,

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.934
there is something
wrong with our politics,

00:01:09.934 --> 00:01:11.700
and that's what
we've got to fix.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.033
Because we know there are things
Congress can do, right now,

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.066
to get more money
back in your pockets,

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.700
get this economy growing
faster, and get our friends and

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.100
neighbors back to work.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.834
That payroll tax cut that put
$1,000 back in the average

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:26.667
family's pocket this year?

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:28.266
Let's extend it.

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.400
Construction workers who've
been jobless since the housing

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.066
boom went bust?

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:35.100
Let's put them back to
work rebuilding America.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.333
Let's cut red tape in the patent
process so entrepreneurs can get

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.066
good ideas to
market more quickly.

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.500
Let's finish trade deals so we
can sell more American-made

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.800
goods around the world.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.767
Let's connect the hundreds of
thousands of brave Americans

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:51.800
coming home from Iraq and
Afghanistan to businesses that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.133
need their incredible
skills and talents.

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:57.567
These are all things
we can do right now.

00:01:57.567 --> 00:01:59.133
So let's do them.

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.867
And over the coming weeks, I'll
put forward more proposals to

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:04.066
help our businesses
hire and create jobs,

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:06.667
and I won't stop until every
American who wants a job

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:08.300
can find one.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.033
But we can't let partisan
brinksmanship get in our way --

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.333
the idea that making it through
the next election is more

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:17.867
important than
making things right.

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:20.867
That's what's holding us back --
the fact that some in Congress

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:25.600
would rather see their opponents
lose than see America win.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.600
So you've got a right
to be frustrated.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.900
I know I am.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.967
Because you deserve better.

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:33.367
And I don't think it's too much
for you to expect that the

00:02:33.367 --> 00:02:37.600
people you send to this town
start delivering for you.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.033
Members of Congress are at home
in their districts right now.

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:43.533
And if you agree with me --
whether you're a Democrat or a

00:02:43.533 --> 00:02:48.400
Republican or not much of a
fan of either -- let them know.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.100
If you've had it with gridlock,
and you want them to pass

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.700
stalled bills that will help
our economy right now --

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.467
let them know.

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:58.000
If you refuse to settle for a
politics where scoring points is

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.100
more important than
solving problems;

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.266
if you believe it's time to put
country before party and the

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.200
interests of our
children before our own,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.033
then let them know.

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:09.800
And maybe they'll get back to
Washington ready to compromise,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.934
ready to create jobs, ready to
get our fiscal house in order --

00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:17.600
ready to do what you
sent them here to do.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.867
Yes, we've still got a long
way to go to get to where we

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:21.367
need to be.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.333
We didn't get into
this mess overnight,

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:25.700
and it's going to take
time to get out of it.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.834
That's a hard truth -- but
it's no excuse for inaction.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.834
After all, America voted
for divided government,

00:03:32.834 --> 00:03:36.433
not dysfunctional government,
and we've got work to do.

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:38.266
And when we come together
and find common ground,

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:40.867
there is no stopping
this country.

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:42.767
There's no stopping our people.

00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:44.767
There's no holding us back.

00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:47.000
And there is every reason to
believe we'll get through this

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.633
storm to a brighter day.

00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:51.700
Thanks for listening,
and have a great weekend.
