00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:11.367
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:14.467
Restoring the idea of
opportunity for all

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:17.166
requires a year of
action from all of us.

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.767
Wherever I can act on my
own, I will --

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:22.033
and whenever I can ask more
Americans to help,

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.700
I'll do that too.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.467
In my State of the Union
Address, for example,

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:28.133
I asked more business
leaders to take action

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.633
to raise their
employees' wages.

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.300
Because even though our
economy is growing,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.367
and our businesses have
created about eight

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.200
and a half million new jobs
over the past four years,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.467
average wages have
barely budged.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.633
So it's good news that,
earlier this week,

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:46.066
one of America's largest
retailers, The Gap,

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.734
decided to raise wages for
its employees beginning

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:50.100
this year.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.133
Their decision will
benefit

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.133
about 65,000 workers

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:56.367
in the U.S. That means more
families will be able to raise

00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:58.667
their kids, finish their
studies,

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:01.066
or keep up on their bills with a little

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.667
less financial stress and strain.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.100
Gap's CEO explained their
decision simply -- he said,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.133
"[It's] right for our
brands, good for our

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:12.233
people, and beneficial
to our customers."

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:14.967
And he's right - raising
Americans' wages isn't

00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:17.734
just a good deed; it's
good business

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:19.533
and good for our economy.

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:23.000
It helps reduce turnover,
it boosts productivity,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.333
and it gives folks some
more money to spend

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.433
at local businesses.

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:29.467
And as a chief executive
myself, that's why I took

00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:32.166
action last week to lift
more workers' wages

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.800
by requiring federal
contractors to pay their

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.333
employees a fair wage of
at least $10.10 an hour.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.500
In the year since I first
asked Congress to raise

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.166
the minimum wage, six
states have passed laws

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.600
to raise theirs, and more
states are working

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.500
on it as we speak.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.867
But only Congress can
finish the job

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:53.300
and lift Americans' wages
across the country.

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:56.266
Right now, there's a bill
before Congress that would

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:57.633
boost America's minimum
wage

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:02.533
to $10.10 an hour. That's easy
to remember - "ten-ten."

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:05.500
That bill would lift wages
for more than 16 million

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.767
Americans without
requiring a single dollar

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:10.633
in new taxes or spending.

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:12.533
But even though a
majority of Democrats,

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:14.467
Independents, and
Republicans across the

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.934
country support raising
the minimum wage,

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:18.700
Republicans in Congress
don't want

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.700
to give it a vote.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.600
Hardworking Americans
deserve better than "no."

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.033
Let's tell Congress
to say "yes."

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:27.600
Pass that bill.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.600
Give America a raise.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.433
Because here in America,
no one who works hard

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:34.166
should have to live in
poverty --

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:36.834
and everyone who works hard
should have a chance

00:02:36.834 --> 00:02:38.467
to get ahead.

00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:40.033
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
