00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.512
Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:16.182
This week, we made it
official-I'm going to Cuba.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.218
When Michelle and I go
to Havana next month,

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:19.786
it will be the first
visit of a

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:23.356
U.S. president to Cuba
in nearly 90 years.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.358
And it builds on the
decision I made more than a

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.961
year ago to begin a new
chapter in our relationship

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.397
with the people of Cuba.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:33.500
You see, I believe that the
best way to advance American

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.302
interests and values, and
the best way to help the

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.405
Cuban people
improve their lives,

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:41.107
is through engagement-by
normalizing relations

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:43.943
between our governments and
increasing the contacts

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:45.879
between our peoples.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.881
I've always said that
change won't come

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.682
to Cuba overnight.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:52.652
But as Cuba opens up, it
will mean more opportunity

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:55.555
and resources for
ordinary Cubans.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.558
And we're starting
to see some progress.

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:01.594
Today, the American flag
flies over our embassy in

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:04.764
Havana, and our diplomats
are interacting more broadly

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:06.633
with the Cuban people.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.736
More Americans are visiting
Cuba than at any time in the

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:14.307
last 50 years-Cuban-American
families; American students,

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:17.477
teachers, humanitarian
volunteers,

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:20.980
faith communities-all
forging new ties and

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.217
friendships that are
bringing our countries closer.

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:26.820
And when direct flights
and ferries resume,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.055
even more of our citizens
will have the chance to

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:32.559
travel and work together
and know each other.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.561
American companies are
starting to do business in

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:37.597
Cuba, helping to nurture
private enterprise and

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:41.134
giving Cuban entrepreneurs
new opportunities.

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:44.170
With new Wi-Fi hotspots,
more Cubans are starting to

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.672
go online and get
information

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.740
from the outside world.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.543
In both our countries,
there's overwhelming support

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:51.811
for this new relationship.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.814
And in Cuba today, for
the first time in a half

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:58.551
century, there is hope
for a different future,

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.254
especially among Cuba's
young people who have such

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:04.224
extraordinary talent and
potential just waiting

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:06.292
to be unleashed.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.294
My visit will be an
opportunity to

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.462
keep moving forward.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:12.065
I'll meet with President
Castro to discuss how we can

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.067
continue normalizing
relations,

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:16.636
including making it easier
to trade and easier for

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.972
Cubans to access the
Internet and start their

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.607
own businesses.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:23.209
As I did when I met
President Castro last year,

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.879
I'll speak candidly about
our serious differences with

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.448
the Cuban government,
including on democracy

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.183
and human rights.

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:32.285
I'll reaffirm that the
United States will continue

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:34.521
to stand up for universal
values like freedom of

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.490
speech and assembly
and religion.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.492
I'll meet with members
of Cuba's civil

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:42.595
society-courageous men and
women who give voice to the

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.998
aspirations of
the Cuban people.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.000
I'll meet with Cuban
entrepreneurs to learn how

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.335
we can help them
start new ventures.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.105
And I'll speak directly to
the Cuban people about the

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:55.174
values we share and how I
believe we can be partners

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:58.044
as they work for the
future they want.

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:00.179
We're still in the early
days of our new relationship

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.814
with the Cuban people.

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.017
This transformation
will take time.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.251
But I'm focused
on the future,

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:07.954
and I'm confident that my
visit will advance the goals

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:10.423
that guide us-promoting
American interests and

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:13.893
values and a better future
for the Cuban people,

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:18.131
a future of more freedom
and more opportunity.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:19.432
Thanks everybody.

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:23.336
And to the people of
Cuba-nos vemos en La Habana.
