00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:07.934
The President:
I've spent some time lately
traveling the country and

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:10.533
talking with folks
outside of Washington.

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.934
And the number one issue for the
people I meet is how we can get

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:16.233
back to a place where
we're creating good,

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:19.900
middle-class jobs that pay
well and offer some security.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.667
That's the idea behind
the American Jobs Act.

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:25.967
It's a jobs bill that does two
simple things: put more people

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:28.934
back to work, and more money
back in the pockets of people

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:30.667
who are working.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:33.233
This jobs bill puts construction
workers back to work rebuilding

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:36.333
our roads and bridges and
modernizing our schools.

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.000
This jobs bill puts teachers
back in the classroom,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.200
and keeps cops and
firefighters on our streets.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.800
This jobs bill gives tax credits
to companies that hire our

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.767
veterans, because if you sign
up to fight for our country,

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:50.500
the last thing you should have
to do is fight for a job when

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.066
you come home.

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.133
This jobs bill connects the
long-term unemployed to

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:57.100
temporary work to keep their
skills sharp while they look for

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.200
a job, and it gives hundreds of
thousands of young people the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.700
hope of a job next summer.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.233
This jobs bill cuts taxes for
every small business owner

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:07.967
in America.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.867
It cuts them even more for small
business owners that hire new

00:01:10.867 --> 00:01:13.633
workers and raise
workers' salaries.

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:16.967
And it cuts taxes for every
working family in America so

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:19.100
that you'll have more
money in your pockets,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.834
and businesses know they'll
have more customers to buy

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:23.567
what they sell.

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:26.166
That's the American Jobs Act,
and you can check it out for

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.266
yourself on WhiteHouse.gov.

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.800
It will create new jobs.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.800
It'll cut taxes for every
worker and small business in

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.633
the country.

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:35.800
And it will not
add to the deficit.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.033
It will be paid for.

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:40.467
On Monday, I'll lay out my
plan for how we'll do that --

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.433
how we'll pay for this plan and
pay down our debt by following

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:47.100
some basic principles: making
sure we live within our means

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.033
and asking everyone to
pay their fair share.

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:53.967
But right now, we've got to get
Congress to pass this jobs bill.

00:01:53.967 --> 00:01:56.433
Everything in the American Jobs
Act is the kind of idea that's

00:01:56.433 --> 00:02:00.333
been supported by Democrats
and Republicans before.

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:02.633
And if they're ideas
you agree with,

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:05.867
then every one of you can help
make it happen by telling your

00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:09.633
congressperson to pass
this jobs bill right away.

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:11.667
I know some of them would rather
wait another year to wage

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:15.000
another election than
work together right now.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
But most Americans don't
have the luxury of waiting.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.834
It was three years ago this week
that a financial crisis on Wall

00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:23.567
Street made things much more
difficult for working folks

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:25.100
on Main Street.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.767
And too many are still
hurting as a result.

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:30.166
So the time for action is now.

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:31.233
No more games.

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:32.533
No more gridlock.

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:34.734
No more division or delay.

00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:36.934
It's time for the people you
sent to Washington to put

00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:40.033
country before party -- to stop
worrying so much about their

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:43.800
jobs and start worrying
more about yours.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.667
It's time to get to work and
show the world once again why

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:49.266
the United States of
America remains the greatest

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:50.700
nation on Earth.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.734
Thanks.
