00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.778
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:14.647
As 2014 comes to an end,
we can enter the New Year

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.750
with new confidence
that America is making

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.019
significant strides
where it counts.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.288
The steps we took nearly
six years ago to rescue

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:25.225
our economy and rebuild it
on a new foundation helped

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:28.895
make 2014 the strongest
year for job growth

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:31.064
since the 1990s.

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.767
Over the past 57 months,
our businesses have

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.770
created nearly 11
million new jobs.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.773
And in a hopeful sign for
middle-class families,

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.308
wages are on
the rise again.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:44.310
Our investments in
American manufacturing

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.413
have helped fuel its best
stretch of job growth

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.014
since the '90s.

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.150
America is now the number
one producer of oil

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.286
and gas, saving drivers about
70 cents a gallon at the

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:55.622
pump over last
Christmas.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.624
The auto industry we
rescued is on track

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:01.194
for its strongest
year since 2005.

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:03.196
Thanks to the Affordable
Care Act, about 10 million

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.165
Americans have gained
health insurance

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.166
in the past
year alone.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.802
And since I took office,
we have cut our deficits

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:11.237
by about two-thirds.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:14.507
Meanwhile, around the
world, America is leading.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.509
We're leading the
coalition to degrade

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.044
and ultimately
destroy ISIL.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:20.046
We're leading the global
fight to combat the

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.449
Ebola outbreak
in West Africa.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.451
We're leading global
efforts to address climate

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.453
change, including
last month's joint

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:28.388
announcement
with China.

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:30.690
We're turning a new page
in our relationship with

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.592
the Cuban people.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.994
And in less than two
weeks, after more than

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:38.331
13 years, our combat
mission in Afghanistan

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:40.934
will be over, and our
war there will come

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.470
to a responsible end.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.840
Today, more of our troops
are home for the holidays

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.210
than at any time
in over a decade.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.278
Still, many of our men
and women in uniform will

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.280
spend this Christmas
in harm's way.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.784
And as Commander-in-Chief,
I want our troops to know:

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:01.221
your country is united in
our support and gratitude

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.556
for you and
your families.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.558
The six years since the
financial crisis have

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:09.496
demanded hard work and
sacrifice on everyone's part.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:12.165
But as a country, we have
every right to be proud

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.434
of what we've got
to show for it.

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:15.535
More jobs.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:16.636
More insured.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:17.837
A growing economy.

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:19.439
Shrinking deficits.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.740
Bustling industry.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.675
Booming energy.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.844
Pick any metric
you want,

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:26.579
America's
resurgence is real.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.249
And we now have the
chance to reverse the

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.086
decades-long erosion of
middle-class jobs and incomes.

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.088
We just have to invest in
the things that we know

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:37.590
will secure even faster
growth in higher-paying

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.859
jobs for more Americans.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.195
We have to make sure our
economy, our justice

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:44.964
system, and our government
work not only for a few,

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:45.965
but for all of us.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:48.635
And I look forward to
working together with the

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:52.238
new Congress next year
on these priorities.

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:54.941
Sure, we'll disagree
on some things.

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:57.110
We'll have to
compromise on others.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.146
I'll act on my own
when it's necessary.

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:02.115
But I will never stop
trying to make life better

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.583
for people like you.

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.318
Because thanks
to your efforts,

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:07.287
a new foundation
is laid.

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.822
A new future is
ready to be written.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.824
We have set the stage for
a new American moment,

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.394
and I'm going to spend
every minute of my last

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:17.363
two years making
sure we seize it.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.766
On behalf of the Obama
family, I wish all

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.901
of you a very
Merry Christmas.

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:24.137
Thanks, and have a
wonderful holiday season.
