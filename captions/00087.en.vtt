00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:11.436
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:13.504
This week, I spent some
time in Colorado

00:00:13.504 --> 00:00:16.107
and Texas, talking with people
about what's going

00:00:16.107 --> 00:00:17.108
on in their lives.

00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:20.178
One of them was Elizabeth
Cooper,

00:00:20.178 --> 00:00:22.447
who'll be a college junior this fall.

00:00:22.447 --> 00:00:24.682
She wrote to tell me
something I hear often:

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:26.651
how hard it is for
middle-class families

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:29.354
like hers to afford college.

00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:31.322
And she shared something I
know many of you feel

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.858
when you wonder what's
going on in Washington.

00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:36.494
She said she feels "not
significant enough

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:39.230
to be addressed, not poor enough
for people

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.335
to worry about, and not rich
enough to be cared about."

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:46.371
I ran for President to
fight for Americans

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:49.540
just like Elizabeth - people
who work hard,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.542
do everything right, and just
want a chance

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:54.846
to build a decent life for
themselves and their families.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.982
And after the worst
economic crisis

00:00:57.982 --> 00:00:59.984
in generations, our
businesses have

00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:00.985
now created nearly 10 million

00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:03.454
new jobs over the past 52 months.

00:01:03.454 --> 00:01:05.456
The unemployment rate has
fallen

00:01:05.456 --> 00:01:07.792
to its lowest point since 2008.

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:09.794
By almost every measure,
our economy

00:01:09.794 --> 00:01:11.796
is better off than it was
five years ago.

00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:14.098
But while we've created
more jobs at this point

00:01:14.098 --> 00:01:16.901
of the year than any year
since 1999,

00:01:16.901 --> 00:01:21.005
too many families barely earn
what they did in 1999.

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.141
It's harder to pay for
college, save,

00:01:23.141 --> 00:01:24.909
or retire, because people's

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.478
wages and
incomes have not gone up.

00:01:27.478 --> 00:01:29.480
Nearly all the gains of
the recovery are going

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.482
to the very top - and aren't
making

00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:32.617
a difference in your lives.

00:01:32.617 --> 00:01:35.887
And I believe America does
better

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:37.889
when the middle class does better.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.891
And I've laid out an
opportunity agenda

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.693
to create jobs, train
workers, educate our kids,

00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:45.163
and make sure hard work
actually pays off.

00:01:46.197 --> 00:01:48.199
These are the things we
should be doing

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:50.201
to grow the middle class and
help folks work their

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:51.903
way into the middle class.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.872
And it's pretty
uncontroversial stuff.

00:01:54.872 --> 00:01:56.974
I hope we can work
together on it.

00:01:56.974 --> 00:01:59.877
And I'm always willing to
compromise if folks have

00:01:59.877 --> 00:02:02.313
other ideas or if it
advances generally

00:02:02.313 --> 00:02:04.282
the interests of
working Americans.

00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:06.517
But so far this year,
Republicans in Congress

00:02:06.517 --> 00:02:08.286
have blocked every serious

00:02:08.286 --> 00:02:11.155
idea to strengthen the middle class.

00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:13.724
Lifting the minimum wage,
fair pay,

00:02:13.724 --> 00:02:17.195
student loan reform - they've
said no to all of it.

00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:19.230
And that's when I've acted
this year

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.100
to help working Americans on my
own- when Congress won't act.

00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:26.437
I've taken actions to
attract new jobs,

00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:28.539
lift workers' wages, help
students

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.142
pay off their loans, and more.

00:02:31.142 --> 00:02:34.579
And the Republican plan
right now is not to do some

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.015
of this work with me -
instead, it's to sue me.

00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:39.016
That's actually what
they're

00:02:39.016 --> 00:02:40.351
spending their time on.

00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:42.353
It's a political stunt
that's going to waste

00:02:42.353 --> 00:02:43.721
months of America's time.

00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:44.722
And by the way, they're
going

00:02:44.722 --> 00:02:47.091
to pay for it using your
hard-earned tax dollars.

00:02:48.392 --> 00:02:52.363
I have a better idea:
do something, Congress.

00:02:52.363 --> 00:02:54.799
Do anything to help
working Americans.

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:55.800
Join the rest
of the country.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.301
Join me, I'm looking
forward

00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:59.470
to working with you.

00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:01.506
You know, on Tuesday, I
met with Carolyn Reed

00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:02.507
and her husband David,

00:03:02.507 --> 00:03:05.009
who own six Silver Mine Sub shops in Colorado.

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.513
Two days later, they
announced they're giving

00:03:08.513 --> 00:03:10.548
their hourly employees a
raise to ten dollars

00:03:10.548 --> 00:03:11.549
and ten cents an hour.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.752
They're not waiting
for Congress.

00:03:14.752 --> 00:03:17.355
Carolyn said, "We are
happy to be a part

00:03:17.355 --> 00:03:19.357
of what I hope will be a growing
voluntary

00:03:19.357 --> 00:03:21.259
trend in increased wages."

00:03:22.593 --> 00:03:24.962
Carolyn and Americans like
her all across

00:03:24.962 --> 00:03:28.065
the country are happy to
do their part.

00:03:28.065 --> 00:03:31.969
Congress now needs to
step up and do its part.

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.005
And next week, I'll travel
to a couple of job sites

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:36.007
to talk about how
Democrats and Republicans

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.009
can work together to grow
the economy

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.979
and protect nearly 700,000 jobs
by passing a highway

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:43.381
bill by the end of the summer.

00:03:45.116 --> 00:03:47.518
I'm here because
hardworking Americans

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:50.454
like Elizabeth and Carolyn.

00:03:50.454 --> 00:03:52.456
That's something I'll
never forget -

00:03:52.456 --> 00:03:55.293
it's something I'll never
stop fighting for.

00:03:55.293 --> 00:03:57.295
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
