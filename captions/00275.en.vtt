00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:07.734
The President:
As the political
season heats up,

00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:10.767
Americans are already being
inundated with the usual phone

00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:16.133
calls and mailings and TV ads
from campaigns all across the country.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.467
But this summer, they're also
seeing a flood of attack ads run

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:22.834
by shadowy groups with
harmless-sounding names.

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:25.367
We don't know who's behind these
ads and we don't know who's

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:27.133
paying for them.

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.667
The reason this is happening is
because of a decision by the

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:32.900
Supreme Court in the
Citizens United case --

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.600
a decision that now allows big
corporations to spend unlimited

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.967
amounts of money to
influence our elections.

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:42.567
They can buy millions of
dollars worth of TV ads --

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:45.900
and worst of all, they don't
even have to reveal who is

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.967
actually paying for them.

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:51.000
You don't know if it's a
foreign-controlled corporation.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.767
You don't know if it's BP.

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:56.233
You don't know if it's a big
insurance company or a Wall Street Bank.

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:59.400
A group can hide behind a phony
name like "Citizens for a Better

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.066
Future," even if a more accurate
name would be "Corporations for

00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.834
Weaker Oversight."

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:06.967
We tried to fix this last month.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.700
There was a proposal supported
by Democrats and Republicans

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.600
that would've required corporate
political advertisers to reveal

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.734
who's funding their activities.

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:17.934
When special interests
take to the airwaves,

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:20.867
whoever is running and funding
the ad would have to appear in

00:01:20.867 --> 00:01:23.633
the advertisement and take
responsibility for it --

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:27.567
like a company's CEO or
an organization's biggest contributor.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:30.400
And foreign-controlled
corporations and entities would

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.967
be restricted from spending
money to influence American

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:36.433
elections -- just as they were in the past.

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:39.467
You would think that making
these reforms would be a matter

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:41.233
of common sense.

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:43.567
You'd think that reducing
corporate and even foreign

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:47.266
influence over our elections
wouldn't be a partisan issue.

00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:50.400
But the Republican leaders
in Congress said no.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.433
In fact, they used their power
to block the issue from even

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:54.967
coming up for a vote.

00:01:54.967 --> 00:01:57.333
This can only mean that the
leaders of the other party want

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.367
to keep the public in the dark.

00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:03.467
They don't want you to know
which interests are paying for the ads.

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:06.533
The only people who don't want
to disclose the truth are people

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.300
with something to hide.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.600
Well, we cannot allow the
corporate takeover of our democracy.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.166
So we're going to continue
to fight for reform and transparency.

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:19.166
And I urge all of you to
take up the same fight.

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:21.633
Let's challenge every elected
official who benefits from these

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:26.100
ads to defend this practice
or join us in stopping it.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.400
At a time of such
challenge for America,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.967
we can't afford these
political games.

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:33.633
Millions of Americans are
struggling to get by,

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:36.066
and their voices shouldn't be
drowned out by millions of

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:39.367
dollars in secret, special
interest advertising.

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:41.667
Their voices should be heard.

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:43.266
Let's not forget
that a century ago,

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:46.400
it was a Republican President -- Teddy Roosevelt --

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.066
who first tried to tackle the
issue of corporate influence on

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:50.700
our elections.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.367
He actually called it "one
of the principal sources of

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:55.867
corruption in our
political affairs."

00:02:55.867 --> 00:02:59.767
And he proposed strict limits
on corporate influence in elections.

00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:03.400
"Every special interest is
entitled to justice," he said.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.600
"but not one is entitled
to a vote in Congress,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.100
to a voice on the bench, or to
representation in any public office."

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.100
We now face a similar challenge,
and a similar opportunity to

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.667
prevent special interests from
gaining even more clout in Washington.

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:22.767
This shouldn't be a Democratic
issue or a Republican issue.

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:25.367
This is an issue that goes to
whether or not we have a

00:03:25.367 --> 00:03:28.266
democracy that works for
ordinary Americans --

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:31.767
a government of, by,
and for the people.

00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:36.033
Let's show the cynics and the
special interests that we still can.
