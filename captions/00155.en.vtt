00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.967
The President:
This week, I've been traveling
across the country --

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:11.767
from North Carolina to Georgia
to here at Hyde Park Academy in

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:14.900
my hometown of Chicago --
talking with folks about the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.567
important tasks that I laid
out in my State of the Union

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:21.567
Address: reigniting the true
engine of America's economic

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:25.900
growth -- a rising,
thriving middle class.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.400
Every day, we should ask
ourselves three questions:

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.266
How do we bring good
jobs to America?

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.934
How do we equip people with
the skills those jobs require?

00:00:35.934 --> 00:00:39.133
And how do we make sure
your hard work leads to a

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.433
decent living?

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:43.734
I believe all that starts by
making America a magnet for new

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:45.834
jobs and manufacturing.

00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:47.700
After shedding jobs
for more than 10 years,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.834
our manufacturers have added
about 500,000 jobs over

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:52.667
the past three.

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:54.567
What we need to
do now is simple.

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:56.800
We need to accelerate
that trend.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.433
We need to launch manufacturing
hubs across the country that

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:03.166
will transform hard-hit regions
into global centers of high-tech

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.200
jobs and manufacturing.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.533
We need to make our tax
code more competitive,

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.333
ending tax breaks for companies
that ship jobs overseas,

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.600
and rewarding companies that
create jobs here at home.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.567
And we need to invest in the
research and technology that

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:20.033
will allow us to harness more
of our energy and put more

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:24.300
people back to work repairing
our crumbling roads and bridges.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.700
These steps will help
our businesses expand and

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.266
create new jobs.

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.500
But we also need to provide
every American with the skills

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.834
and training that they
need to fill those jobs.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:36.200
Let's start in the earliest
years by offering high-quality

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.367
pre-school to every
child in America,

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:40.533
because we know kids in
these programs do better

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.300
throughout their lives.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.100
Let's redesign our high schools
so that our students graduate

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.500
with the skills that employers
are looking for right now.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.000
And because taxpayers can't
continue to subsidize the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.233
soaring cost of
higher education,

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:56.166
I've called on Congress to take
affordability and value into

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:59.467
account when determining which
colleges receive certain types

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:01.533
of federal aid.

00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:04.800
So those are steps we can take
to help bring good jobs to

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.600
America and equip our people
with the skills those

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.500
jobs require.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.800
And that brings us to
the third question --

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.266
how do we make sure hard work
leads to a decent living?

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:17.433
No one in America should work
full-time and raise their

00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:18.734
children in poverty.

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:21.333
So let's raise the minimum
wage so that it's a wage you

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:22.734
can live on.

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:25.133
And it's time to harness
the talents and ingenuity of

00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:28.266
hardworking immigrants by
finally passing comprehensive

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:31.133
immigration reform --
securing our borders,

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:34.433
establishing a responsible
path to earned citizenship,

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:36.533
and attracting the
highly-skilled entrepreneurs

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:39.700
and engineers that
will help create jobs.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.433
These steps will help grow our
economy and rebuild a rising,

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:45.200
thriving middle class.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.200
And we can do it while
shrinking our deficits.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.567
We don't have to choose
between the two --

00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:52.533
we just have to
make smart choices.

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:55.367
Over the last few years, both
parties have worked together to

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:58.233
reduce the deficit by
more than $2.5 trillion --

00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:02.200
which puts us more than halfway
towards the goal of $4 trillion

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.400
in deficit reduction that
economists say we need to

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.433
stabilize our finances.

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:08.467
Now we need to finish the job.

00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:11.166
But I disagree with Republicans
who think we should do that by

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:13.834
making even bigger cuts to
things like education and job

00:03:13.834 --> 00:03:17.667
training, or Medicare and
Social Security benefits.

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:21.033
That would force our senior
citizens and working families to

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.834
bear the burden of deficit
reduction while the wealthiest

00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:25.800
are asked to do nothing more.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.233
That won't work.

00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:29.867
We can't just cut our
way to prosperity.

00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:32.066
Instead, I've proposed
a balanced approach;

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:34.967
one that makes responsible
reforms to bring down the cost

00:03:34.967 --> 00:03:37.500
of health care and saves
hundreds of billions of dollars

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.934
by getting rid of tax loopholes
and deductions for the well-off

00:03:40.934 --> 00:03:42.600
and well-connected.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.400
And we should finally
pursue bipartisan,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.934
comprehensive tax reform that
encourages job creation and

00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:49.633
helps bring down the deficit.

00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:51.567
So we know what we need to do.

00:03:51.567 --> 00:03:54.300
All the steps I've
mentioned are commonsense.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.333
And, together, they will help us
grow our economy and strengthen

00:03:57.333 --> 00:03:59.300
our middle class.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.934
In the coming weeks and
months, our work won't be easy,

00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:03.800
and we won't agree
on everything.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.633
But America only moves forward
when we do so together --

00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:10.400
when we accept certain
obligations to one another and

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.367
to future generations.

00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:14.233
That's the American story.

00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:15.900
And that is how we will
write the next great

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.667
chapter -- together.

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:20.433
Thanks and have a great weekend.
