00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.411
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.813
I've talked a lot lately
about why new trade deals

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.049
are important
to our economy.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.184
Today, I want to talk about
why new trade deals are

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.787
important to our values.

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:23.289
They're vital to
middle-class economics --

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.426
the idea that this country
does best when everyone gets

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.795
their fair shot, everyone
does their fair share,

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.931
and everyone plays by
the same set of rules.

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.600
These are simple values.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.168
They're American values.

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:37.804
And we strive to make sure
our own economy lives up to

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.407
them, especially after a
financial crisis brought

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:43.510
about by recklessness
and greed.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.845
But we also live in a world
where our workers have to

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:48.882
compete on a global scale.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.384
Right now, on an
uneven playing field.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.385
Where the rules
are different.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.889
And that's why America has
to write the rules of the

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:59.058
global economy -- so that
our workers can compete

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:00.226
on a level playing field.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.096
I understand why a lot of
people are skeptical

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.464
of trade deals.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:07.167
Past deals didn't always
live up to the hype.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:09.169
They didn't include the
kind of protections

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:11.371
we're fighting for today.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.373
We have lessons to
learn from the past

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.108
-- and we have
learned them.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:18.144
But trying to stop a global
economy at our shores

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:20.046
isn't one of
those lessons.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.849
We can't surrender to the
future -- because we are

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.918
meant to win the future.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.520
If America doesn't shape the
rules of the global economy

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.190
today, to benefit
our workers,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.325
while our economy is in
a position of new global

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:36.329
strength, then China
will write those rules.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.998
I've seen towns where
manufacturing collapsed,

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:41.000
plants closed down,
and jobs dried up.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.704
And I refuse to accept
that for our workers.

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:47.974
Because I know when the
playing field is level,

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.342
nobody can beat us.

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:50.910
That's why, when
I took office,

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.580
we started thinking about
how to revamp trade in a way

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.316
that actually works
for working Americans.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:59.085
And that's what we've done
with a new trade partnership

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.654
we're negotiating in
the Asia-Pacific --

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:04.757
home to the world's
fastest-growing markets.

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:08.127
It's the highest-standard
trade agreement in history.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:10.530
It's got strong provisions
for workers and the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.665
environment --
provisions that,

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:16.536
unlike in past agreements,
are actually enforceable.

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:19.205
If you want in, you have
to meet these standards.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:21.875
If you don't,
then you're out.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.877
Once you're a part
of this partnership,

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:25.879
if you violate your
responsibilities,

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.014
there are actually
consequences.

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:30.016
And because it would
include Canada and Mexico,

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:33.720
it fixes a lot of what was
wrong with NAFTA, too.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.722
So this isn't a
race to the bottom,

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:38.391
for lower wages and
working conditions.

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.760
The trade agreements I'm
negotiating will drive

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.729
a race to the top.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.731
And we're making sure
American workers can

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.500
retool through training programs
and community colleges,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.638
and use new skills to
transition into new jobs.

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:53.973
If I didn't think this was
the right thing to do for

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:57.143
working families, I wouldn't
be fighting for it.

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:59.746
We've spent the past six
years trying to rescue

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:02.549
the economy, retool
the auto industry,

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.718
and revitalize American
manufacturing.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:08.555
And if there were ever an
agreement that undercut that

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.824
progress, or hurt those
workers, I wouldn't sign it.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.093
My entire presidency is
about helping working

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:16.829
families recover from
recession and rebuild for

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.231
the future.

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:20.433
As long as I'm President,
that's what I'll keep

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.435
fighting to do.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:24.437
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
