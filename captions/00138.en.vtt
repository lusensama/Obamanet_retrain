00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.567
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:10.633
A few days ago, I unveiled
a new national plan

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:14.600
to confront the growing threat
of a changing climate.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.867
Decades of carefully reviewed
science tells us our planet

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:20.233
is changing in ways that
will have profound impacts

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:22.633
on the world we
leave our children.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:25.300
Already we know that
the 12 warmest years

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.400
in recorded history

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.667
have all come
in the last 15,

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:32.400
and that last year was the
warmest in American history.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.500
And while we know no
single weather event

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.767
is caused solely
by climate change,

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:37.900
we also know that,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.567
in a world that's getting
warmer than it used to be,

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:43.133
all weather events
are affected by it --

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:48.467
more extreme droughts, floods,
wildfires, and hurricanes.

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:50.734
Those who already feel the
effects of a changing climate

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:52.500
don't have time to deny it.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500
They're busy
dealing with it --

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.834
the firefighters who brave 
longer wildfire seasons;

00:00:57.834 --> 00:00:59.900
the farmers who see crops
wilted one year

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.000
and washed away the next;

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.600
western families worried
about water that's drying up.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.600
The costs of these events
can be measured

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.266
in lost lives and livelihoods,

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.233
lost homes and businesses,

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:13.633
and hundreds of billions
of dollars

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:16.100
in emergency services
and disaster relief.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.834
And Americans across the country
are already paying the price

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:22.300
of inaction in
higher food costs,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.133
insurance premiums,
and the tab for rebuilding.

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.934
So the question is not
whether we need to act;

00:01:28.934 --> 00:01:31.633
the question is whether we
will have the courage to act

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:33.700
before it's too late.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.700
The national climate
action plan I unveiled

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.333
will cut carbon pollution,

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:40.166
protect our country from
the impacts of climate change,

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.700
and lead the world
in a coordinated assault

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.633
on a changing climate.

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:46.233
To reduce carbon pollution,

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:48.233
I've directed the 
Environmental Protection Agency

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:51.133
to work with states and
businesses to set new standards

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:54.400
that put an end to the limitless
dumping of carbon pollution

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.233
from our power plants.

00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:58.533
We'll use more clean
energy and waste less energy

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.667
throughout our economy.

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:01.667
To prepare Americans

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:04.266
for the impact of climate change 
we can't stop,

00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:06.400
we'll work with
communities to build smarter,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.300
more resilient infrastructure to
protect our homes and businesses

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.900
and withstand more
powerful storms.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.934
And America will lead global
efforts to combat the threat

00:02:15.934 --> 00:02:18.867
of a changing climate by
encouraging developing nations

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:21.266
to transition to cleaner
sources of energy

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.133
and by engaging our
international partners

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:24.333
in this fight.

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:26.333
For while we compete
for business,

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.100
we also share a planet,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.500
and we must all shoulder
the responsibility

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.633
for its future together.

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:34.700
This is the fight America
can and will lead

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.367
in the 21st century,

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:40.567
but it will require all of us, 
as citizens, to do our part.

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:43.066
We will need scientists
to design new fuels

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:44.867
and farmers to grow them.

00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:47.367
We'll need engineers
to devise new technologies

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.934
and businesses to
make and sell them.

00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:51.800
We'll need workers
to man assembly lines

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.100
that hum with high-tech
zero-carbon components

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.633
and builders to
hammer into place

00:02:56.633 --> 00:03:00.333
the foundations for
a new clean-energy age.

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:01.867
We'll need to give
special care to people

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:04.633
in communities unsettled
by this transition.

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:07.000
And those of us in positions
of responsibility

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.233
will need to be less
concerned with the judgment

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:12.300
of special interests
and well-connected donors

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.967
and more concerned with
the judgment of our children.

00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:19.066
If you agree with me,
I need you to act.

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:21.066
Educate your classmates
and colleagues,

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:22.900
your family and friends.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.967
Speak up in your communities.

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:27.000
Remind everyone
who represents you,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.567
at every level of government,

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:29.767
that there's no contradiction

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:33.133
between a sound environment
and a strong economy,

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:34.834
and that sheltering
future generations

00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:36.867
against the ravages
of climate change

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:40.133
is a prerequisite
for your vote.

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:43.600
We will be judged as a people,
as a society,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.300
and as a country on
where we go from here.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.567
The plan I've put forward
to reduce carbon pollution

00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:52.233
and protect our country from
the effects of climate change

00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:54.867
is the path we need to take.

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:57.133
And if we remember
what's at stake,

00:03:57.133 --> 00:03:59.400
the world we leave
to our children,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.967
I'm convinced that this is a
challenge that we will meet.

00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:06.000
Thanks,
and have a great weekend.
