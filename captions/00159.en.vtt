00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:07.500
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.834
This week, I announced a series
of concrete steps we should take

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:14.934
to protect our children and our
communities from gun violence.

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:17.200
These proposals grew out of
meetings Vice President Biden

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.834
and his task force held over the
last month with more than 200

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:23.633
different groups -- from
parents and teachers;

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:25.834
to law enforcement
and sportsmen;

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:28.934
to religious leaders and
mental health professionals.

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:32.567
And in the weeks ahead, I'll do
everything in my power to make

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:34.033
them a reality.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:37.100
Because while we may not be able
to prevent every senseless act

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.500
of violence in this country, if
there's even one thing that we

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.600
can do to reduce it -- if
even one life can be saved --

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.266
we've got an obligation to try.

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.033
My administration is taking a
series of actions right away --

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:51.934
from strengthening our
background check system,

00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:54.867
to helping schools hire more
resource officers if they want

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:58.100
them, to directing the Centers
for Disease Control to study the

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.166
best ways to reduce
gun violence.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.567
But the truth is, making a real
and lasting difference also

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:08.300
requires Congress to
act -- and act soon.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.734
First, it's time for Congress to
require a universal background

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:14.266
check for anyone
trying to buy a gun.

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.934
The law already requires
licensed gun dealers to perform

00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:21.100
these checks, but as many as
40% of all gun purchases are

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.900
conducted without one.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.934
That's not safe, it's not smart,
and it's not fair to responsible

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:29.133
gun buyers or sellers.

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.900
An overwhelming majority of
Americans agree that anyone

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.367
trying to buy a gun should at
least have to prove that they're

00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:37.934
not a felon, or somebody legally
prohibited from owning one.

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:40.133
That's just common sense.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:44.033
Second, Congress should restore
a ban on military-style assault

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:47.900
weapons, and a 10-round
limit for magazines.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.300
Many assault rifles, when
combined with high-capacity

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.266
magazines, have one purpose
and one purpose only:

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:57.600
to fire as many bullets as
possible as quickly as possible.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.200
These weapons have no
place in our communities.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.000
And a majority of the
American people agree with me.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Finally, Congress needs to make
it easier, rather than harder,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.433
for law enforcement
to do its job.

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:12.066
We should get tougher on people
who buy guns only to turn around

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:13.867
and sell them to criminals.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:16.300
And at a time when many
communities have been forced to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.734
make cuts to their police force,
we should put more cops back on

00:02:19.734 --> 00:02:22.567
the job and back on the street.

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:25.200
Like most Americans, I believe
the Second Amendment guarantees

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.400
an individual
right to bear arms.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.700
We have a strong tradition of
gun ownership in this country,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.767
and the vast majority of
gun owners act responsibly.

00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:37.200
But I also believe most gun
owners agree that we can respect

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.033
the Second Amendment while
keeping an irresponsible,

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:43.533
law-breaking few from causing
harm on a massive scale.

00:02:43.533 --> 00:02:46.767
That's what these reforms
are designed to do.

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:48.667
None of this will be easy.

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:50.800
Already, we're seeing
pundits and politicians

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.433
and special-interest lobbyists
calling any attempt at

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:57.166
commonsense reform an
all-out assault on liberty --

00:02:57.166 --> 00:03:00.133
not because that's true, but
because that's how they get

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:02.934
higher ratings or
make more money.

00:03:02.934 --> 00:03:05.200
And behind the scenes, they're
doing everything they can to

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.300
protect the status quo.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.100
But this time, it
can't be up to them.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.133
It's got to be up to you.

00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:15.033
If, like me, you want
this time to be different,

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:17.767
then I need your help
to make it different.

00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:20.567
Ask your Member of Congress
if they support universal

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:24.200
background checks and renewing
a ban on military-style assault

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.734
weapons and
high-capacity magazines.

00:03:26.734 --> 00:03:29.767
And if the answer is
no, ask them why not.

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:33.166
Ask them why an A-grade from the
gun lobby is more important than

00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:37.467
keeping kids safe in a
first grade classroom.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.000
Since the tragedy in Newtown,
I've gotten letters from all

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.600
over the country -- including
many from our young people.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.400
One of them was from 8-year-old
Rachel, who lives in

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.233
Brooklyn, New York.

00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:51.600
She wrote: "Please do something
so that bad people cannot get

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.600
"guns to kill other people.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.000
"Children should be safe,
especially in school."

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.066
Rachel's counting on us.

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:03.000
Let's get this done for her, and
all the other children in this

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.834
country, and let's make sure
this country is a safer place

00:04:06.834 --> 00:04:10.266
for all children to
learn and to grow.

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:12.200
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
