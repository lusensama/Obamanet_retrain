00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:09.100
The President:
This week, we had two powerful
reminders of how we've renewed

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.333
American leadership
in the world.

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.066
I was proud to announce
that -- as promised --

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.533
the rest of our troops in Iraq
will come home by the end

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.066
of this year.

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.066
And in Libya, the death of
Moammar Qadhafi showed that our

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.467
role in protecting
the Libyan people,

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:25.800
and helping them break
free from a tyrant,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.333
was the right thing to do.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:31.033
In Iraq, we've succeeded in
our strategy to end the war.

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:34.667
Last year, I announced the end
of our combat mission in Iraq.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:37.367
We've already removed
more than 100,000 troops,

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:40.533
and Iraqi forces have taken full
responsibility for the security

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.500
of their own country.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.166
Thanks to the extraordinary
sacrifices of our men and women

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.400
in uniform, the Iraqi people
have the chance to forge their

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.900
own future.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.367
And now the rest of our troops
will be home for the holidays.

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:57.600
In Libya, our brave pilots and
crews helped prevent a massacre,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.467
save countless lives, and give
the Libyan people the chance

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:02.033
to prevail.

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:05.300
Without putting a single U.S.
service member on the ground,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.333
we achieved our objectives.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:11.000
Soon, our NATO mission will come
to a successful end even as we

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.333
continue to support
the Libyan people,

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.300
and people across
the Arab world,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.000
who seek a democratic future.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.166
These successes are
part of a larger story.

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:24.200
After a decade of war, we're
turning the page and moving

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.400
forward, with strength
and with confidence.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.133
The drawdown in Iraq allowed us
to refocus on Afghanistan and

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:35.233
achieve major victories against
al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:37.633
As we remove the last
of our troops from Iraq,

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:41.300
we're beginning to bring our
troops home from Afghanistan.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.300
To put this in perspective,
when I took office,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.033
roughly 180,000 troops were
deployed in these wars.

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:51.333
By the end of this year that
number will be cut in half,

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.867
and an increasing number
of our troops will continue

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:55.266
to come home.

00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:57.433
As we end these wars, we're
focusing on our greatest

00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:00.734
challenge as a nation --
rebuilding our economy and

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.800
renewing our strength at home.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.000
Over the past decade, we spent
a trillion dollars on war,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.266
borrowed heavily from overseas
and invested too little in the

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:14.767
greatest source of our national
strength -- our own people.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.600
Now, the nation we need
to build is our own.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.033
We have to tackle this challenge
with the same urgency and the

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:23.567
same unity that our troops
brought to their fight.

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:25.667
That's why we have to do
everything in our power to get

00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:27.734
our economy moving again.

00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:30.033
That's why I'm calling on
Congress to pass the American

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:32.667
Jobs Act, so we can
rebuild our country --

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:35.200
our schools, our
roads, our bridges --

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.166
and put our veterans,
construction workers, teachers,

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:41.700
cops and firefighters
back to work.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.433
And that's why I hope all of
us can draw strength from the

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:47.400
example of our men
and women in uniform.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.100
They've met their
responsibilities to America.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.834
Now it's time to meet ours.

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:54.433
It's time to come together and
show the world why the United

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:57.800
States of America remains the
greatest source of freedom and

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.233
opportunity that the
world has ever known.
