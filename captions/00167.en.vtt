00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:07.333
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.567
Four years after the worst
economic crisis of our

00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:13.533
lifetimes, our economy is
growing again and creating jobs.

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.667
But we have much more to do.

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:18.667
Our task now is to
build on that progress.

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:20.834
Because this nation only
succeeds when we've got a

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:23.533
growing, thriving middle class.

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.934
That's what drives me.

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:27.867
That's what I campaigned
on for the past year.

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:31.166
That's what will guide me in our
work over the next four years.

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.900
And I'm willing to work with
anyone of any party to move this

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.066
country forward.

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.133
Because soon, we face a very
clear deadline that requires us

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.967
to make some big decisions
on jobs and taxes;

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:44.767
on investments and deficits.

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:47.066
Both parties voted
to set this deadline.

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.567
And I believe both parties can
work together to make these

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:52.867
decisions in a balanced
and responsible way.

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:54.300
When it comes to
taxes, for example,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.400
there are two
paths available.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.233
One says, if Congress fails
to act by the end of the year,

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:02.166
then everybody's taxes
automatically go up --

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.800
including the 98% of
Americans who make less than

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.533
$250,000 a year.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.266
Our economy just can't
afford that right now.

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.300
You can't afford that right now.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.967
And nobody wants that to happen.

00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:18.200
The other path is for Congress
to pass a law right away to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.667
prevent a tax hike on the first
$250,000 of anyone's income.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.166
That means all Americans --

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.900
including the wealthiest
Americans -- get a tax cut.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.633
And 98% of Americans, and 97%
of all small business owners,

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:36.633
won't see their income
taxes go up a single dime.

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:39.266
The Senate has already
passed a bill like this.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.100
Democrats in the House are
ready to pass one, too.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.700
All we need is for Republicans
in the House to come on board.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.066
We shouldn't hold the middle
class hostage while Congress

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.367
debates tax cuts
for the wealthy.

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:53.500
Let's begin our work by actually
doing what we all agree on.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.066
Let's keep taxes low
for the middle class.

00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:58.800
And let's get it done soon --
so we can give families and

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.767
businesses some good news
going into the holiday season.

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:05.066
I know these challenges
won't be easy to solve.

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:08.333
But we can do it if
we work together.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.734
That's why on Friday I sat down
with Congressional leaders to

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:13.233
discuss how we can reduce
our deficit in a way that

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:16.834
strengthens our economy and
protects our middle class.

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:18.400
It was a constructive meeting.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.166
And everyone agreed that while
we may have our differences,

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:24.500
we need to come together, find
solutions and take action as

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.433
soon as possible.

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:29.200
Because if anything, that's the
message I heard loud and clear

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.900
in the election.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.600
Work as hard as you can
to make our lives better.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.333
And do it together.

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:36.800
Don't worry about the politics.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.367
Just get it done.

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:40.633
Everywhere I went
during the campaign --

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:43.300
from the farms of Iowa
to the Vegas strip;

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.433
from Colorado's Rockies
to the Florida coast --

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:48.967
I was inspired by the grit
and resilience of the American

00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:52.567
people, by your hard work
and sense of decency.

00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:55.667
And it makes me want to
work even harder for you.

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:57.100
I saw it again this
week in New York,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.333
where our fellow citizens are
going through a really tough

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:01.800
time, but are helping
each other through it.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.233
And we're going to be
there to help them rebuild.

00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:07.934
Every single day, the good
people of this country work as

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:11.333
hard as you can to meet
your responsibilities.

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:15.800
Those of us that you send to
Washington have to do the same.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.700
Thanks and have a great weekend.
