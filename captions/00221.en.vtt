00:00:05.758 --> 00:00:07.091
The President:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:09.625
It's been almost three weeks
since I sent the American Jobs

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:13.091
Act to Congress -- three weeks
since I sent them a bill that

00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:14.958
would put people back
to work and put money in

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.758
people's pockets.

00:00:16.758 --> 00:00:19.091
This jobs bill is
fully paid for.

00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:21.558
This jobs bill contains
the kinds of proposals that

00:00:21.558 --> 00:00:25.158
Democrats and Republicans
have supported in the past.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.858
And now I want it back.

00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:29.625
It's time for Congress to get
its act together and to pass

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:33.124
this jobs bill so I
can sign it into law.

00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:35.325
Some Republicans in Congress
have said that they agree with

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:37.625
certain parts of this jobs bill.

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:40.258
If so, it's time for them
to tell me what those

00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:42.058
proposals are.

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:43.491
And if they're opposed
to this jobs bill,

00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:46.458
I'd like to know what
exactly they're against.

00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:48.491
Are they against putting
teachers and police officers and

00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:50.958
firefighters back on the job?

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.024
Are they against hiring
construction workers to rebuild

00:00:53.024 --> 00:00:55.591
our roads and
bridges and schools?

00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:58.725
Are they against giving tax cuts
to virtually every worker and

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.958
small business in America?

00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.692
Economists from across the
political spectrum have said

00:01:03.692 --> 00:01:08.024
that this jobs bill would boost
the economy and spur hiring.

00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:09.858
Why would you be against that?

00:01:09.858 --> 00:01:12.291
Especially at a time when so
many Americans are struggling

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:14.158
and out of work.

00:01:14.158 --> 00:01:16.758
This isn't just about
what I think is right.

00:01:16.758 --> 00:01:19.892
It's not just about what a group
of economists think is right.

00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:22.258
This is about what the
American people want.

00:01:22.258 --> 00:01:26.058
Everywhere I go, they tell
me they want action on jobs.

00:01:26.058 --> 00:01:29.158
Every day, I get letters from
Americans who expect Washington

00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:32.758
to do something about
the problems we face.

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:35.558
Destiny Wheeler is a 16-year-old
from Georgia who wants to go

00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:37.124
to college.

00:01:37.124 --> 00:01:39.892
She wrote to me saying,
"Now-a-days it is hard to see

00:01:39.892 --> 00:01:43.425
myself pushing forward and
putting my family in a better

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:47.425
position, especially since the
economy is rough and my starting

00:01:47.425 --> 00:01:49.825
situation is so poor.

00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:53.458
Yet, the American Jobs Act gives
me hope that I might start to

00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:57.058
receive a better education, that
one day job opportunities will

00:01:57.058 --> 00:02:01.024
open for me to grasp, and that
one day my personal American

00:02:01.024 --> 00:02:03.391
Dream will be reached."

00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:06.991
Destiny needs us to
pass this jobs bill.

00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:09.024
Alice Johnson is a
Oregon native who,

00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:11.224
along with her husband, has
been looking for a job for

00:02:11.224 --> 00:02:13.024
about two years.

00:02:13.024 --> 00:02:17.191
She writes, "I have faithfully
applied for work every week...

00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:19.558
Of the hundreds of
applications I have put in,

00:02:19.558 --> 00:02:22.892
I received interview
requests for about 10...

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:26.224
I too, am sick of all the
fighting in Washington, D.C.

00:02:26.224 --> 00:02:28.792
Please tell the Republicans
that people are hurting and are

00:02:28.792 --> 00:02:33.024
hungry and need help,
pass the jobs bill."

00:02:33.024 --> 00:02:35.358
Alice Johnson needs our help.

00:02:35.358 --> 00:02:38.591
Cathleen Dixon sent me pictures
of the aging bridge she drives

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:42.892
under when she takes her kids
to school in Chicago every day.

00:02:42.892 --> 00:02:45.291
She worries about their
safety, and writes,

00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:48.858
"I am angry that in this country
of vast resources we claim that

00:02:48.858 --> 00:02:51.725
we cannot maintain
basic infrastructure.

00:02:51.725 --> 00:02:54.692
How can we ever hope to preserve
or regain our stature in this

00:02:54.692 --> 00:02:58.391
world if we cannot find the
will to protect our people and

00:02:58.391 --> 00:03:00.525
take care of our basic needs?"

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:03.491
I also heard from Kim Faber, who
told me about the small carpet

00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:06.258
business her husband
owns in New Jersey.

00:03:06.258 --> 00:03:08.858
"We hang on by a
shoestring," she writes.

00:03:08.858 --> 00:03:12.725
"My husband worries every day
about if checks might bounce,

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:15.958
he uses our home loan to put
money in the business so they

00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.425
will be covered.

00:03:17.425 --> 00:03:19.591
Please pass this jobs bill!

00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:22.692
This is the job creating
we need right now.

00:03:22.692 --> 00:03:26.191
It breaks my husband's heart
when he has to let people go.

00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:28.525
Pass the bill!"

00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:31.325
Kim said it best: Pass the bill.

00:03:31.325 --> 00:03:33.591
I know one Republican was quoted
as saying that their party

00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:37.825
shouldn't pass this jobs bill
because it would give me a win.

00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:41.892
This isn't about giving me a
win, and it's not about them.

00:03:41.892 --> 00:03:45.391
This is about Destiny
Wheeler and Alice Johnson.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.191
It's about Cathleen
Dixon's children,

00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:49.591
and the Fabers' family business.

00:03:49.591 --> 00:03:51.491
These are the people
who need a win,

00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:54.458
and I will be fighting for
this jobs bill every day on

00:03:54.458 --> 00:03:55.925
their behalf.

00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:57.491
If anyone watching
feels the same way,

00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:00.858
don't be shy about letting
your Congressman know.

00:04:00.858 --> 00:04:03.258
It is time for the
politics to end.

00:04:03.258 --> 00:04:05.325
Let's pass this jobs bill.
