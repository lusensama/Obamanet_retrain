00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:07.300
The President:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.567
As we close the books on
one year and begin another,

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:13.000
I wanted to take a moment today
to wish you a very Happy New

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.433
Year and to talk a little bit
about the year that lies ahead.

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:20.467
At the start of 2011, we're
still just emerging from a

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:24.333
once-in-a-lifetime recession
that's taken a terrible toll on

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.400
millions of families.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.367
We all have friends and
neighbors trying to get their

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:30.667
lives back on track.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:33.934
We are, however, riding a few
months of economic news that

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:36.967
suggests our recovery
is gaining traction.

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:42.066
And our most important task now
is to keep that recovery going.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.734
As President, that's my
commitment to you: to do

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:48.033
everything I can to make
sure our economy is growing,

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:51.667
creating jobs, and
strengthening our middle class.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:54.166
That's my resolution
for the coming year.

00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:58.266
Still, even as we work to boost
our economy in the short-term,

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.834
it's time to make some serious
decisions about how to keep our

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:05.367
economy strong, growing, and
competitive in the long run.

00:01:05.367 --> 00:01:08.133
We have to look ahead
-- not just to this year,

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:11.233
but to the next 10 years,
and the next 20 years.

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:13.533
Where will new
innovations come from?

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:16.000
How will we attract the
companies of tomorrow to set up

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.367
shop and create jobs
in our communities?

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:22.066
What will it take
to get those jobs?

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:26.100
What will it take to out-compete
other countries around the world?

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.033
What will it take to see the
American Dream come true for our

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:31.934
children and grandchildren?

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:35.934
Our parents and grandparents
asked themselves those questions.

00:01:35.934 --> 00:01:38.266
And because they had the
courage to answer them,

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:42.533
we've had the good fortune to grow
up in the greatest nation on Earth.

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:45.367
Now it's our turn to
think about the future.

00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:47.633
In a few days, a new
Congress will form,

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:49.633
with one house
controlled by Democrats,

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:52.100
and one house controlled
by Republicans --

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.200
who now have a shared
responsibility to move this

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.100
country forward.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.667
And here's what I want you to
know: I'm willing to work with

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:02.600
anyone of either party who's got
a good idea and the commitment

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.300
to see it through.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.266
And we should all expect you
to hold us accountable for our

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:10.667
progress or our
failure to deliver.

00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:13.300
As I've said since I
first ran for this office,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.633
solving our challenges
won't be quick or easy.

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:18.600
We've come through
a difficult decade;

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.600
one of new threats and new trials
we didn't expect when it began.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.300
But a new year and a new
decade stretches out before us.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.300
And if we just remember
what America is capable of,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.066
and live up to that legacy, then
I'm confident that we are poised

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:37.367
for a period of progress -- one
in which our economy is growing,

00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:39.400
our standing in the
world is rising,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.233
and we do what it takes to make
sure America remains in the 21st

00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:48.333
century what it was in the 20th:
the greatest country in the world.

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:49.433
Thanks for listening.

00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:50.567
And Happy New Year.
