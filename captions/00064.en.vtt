00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:11.787
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:14.122
About a year ago, I
promised that 2014

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:16.925
would be a breakthrough
year for America.

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:20.762
And this week, we got more
evidence to back that up.

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:25.767
In December, our businesses
created 240,000 new jobs.

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:29.638
The unemployment
rate fell to 5.6%.

00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:32.574
That means that 2014
was the strongest

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:36.311
year for job growth
since the 1990s.

00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:39.281
In 2014, unemployment
fell faster than

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:42.451
it has in three decades.

00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:44.553
Over a 58-month streak,
our businesses have

00:00:44.553 --> 00:00:48.023
created 11.2
million new jobs.

00:00:48.023 --> 00:00:50.926
After a decade of decline,
American manufacturing

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:54.863
is in its best stretch of
job growth since the '90s.

00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:57.532
America is now the world's
number one producer of oil

00:00:57.532 --> 00:01:00.202
and gas, helping to save
drivers about a buck-ten

00:01:00.202 --> 00:01:02.404
a gallon at the pump over
this time last year.

00:01:02.404 --> 00:01:04.506
Thanks to the
Affordable Care Act,

00:01:04.506 --> 00:01:06.875
about 10 million Americans
have gained health insurance

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:08.777
in the past year alone.

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:12.380
We have cut our deficits
by about two-thirds.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.382
And after 13 long
years, our war

00:01:14.382 --> 00:01:16.952
in Afghanistan has come
to a responsible end,

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:18.954
and more of our brave
troops have come home.

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:22.824
It has been six years
since the crisis.

00:01:22.824 --> 00:01:25.193
Those years have demanded
hard work and sacrifice

00:01:25.193 --> 00:01:26.895
on everybody's part.

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:29.464
So as a country, we have
every right to be proud

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:31.833
of what we've got
to show for it.

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:34.336
America's
resurgence is real.

00:01:34.336 --> 00:01:37.072
And now that we've got
some calmer waters,

00:01:37.072 --> 00:01:40.275
if we all do our part,
if we all pitch in,

00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:44.346
we can make sure that tide
starts lifting all boats again.

00:01:44.346 --> 00:01:47.015
We can make sure that the
middle class is the engine

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:51.186
that powers America's
prosperity for decades to come.

00:01:51.186 --> 00:01:53.488
That'll be the focus of my
State of the Union Address

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:57.192
in a couple weeks - building
on the progress we've made.

00:01:57.192 --> 00:02:00.896
But I figured, why wait -
let's get started right now.

00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:04.533
On Wednesday, I visited a Ford
plant outside of Detroit -

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:06.535
because the American
auto industry and its

00:02:06.535 --> 00:02:09.571
home state are redefining
the word "comeback."

00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:11.673
On Thursday, I
traveled to Arizona,

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:14.843
a state that was hit among
the hardest by the housing

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:17.913
crisis, to announce a new
plan that will put hundreds

00:02:17.913 --> 00:02:20.982
of dollars in new
homeowners' pockets,

00:02:20.982 --> 00:02:24.052
and help more new families
buy their first home.

00:02:24.052 --> 00:02:26.855
And, I'm speaking
with you today from

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:30.292
Pellissippi State Community
College in Tennessee,

00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:32.861
a state making big
strides in education,

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.030
to unveil my new plan
to make two years

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.501
of community college free for
every responsible student.

00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:41.503
I'm also here to establish
a new hub that will

00:02:41.503 --> 00:02:45.206
attract more good-paying,
high-tech manufacturing jobs

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:47.609
to our shores.

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.444
Making homeownership
easier.

00:02:49.444 --> 00:02:52.013
Bringing a higher
education within reach.

00:02:52.013 --> 00:02:54.950
Creating more good jobs
that pay good wages.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.952
These are just some of
the ways we can help

00:02:56.952 --> 00:02:59.854
every American get ahead
in the new economy.

00:02:59.854 --> 00:03:01.556
And there's more to come.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.391
Because America
is coming back.

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:06.094
And I want to go
full speed ahead.

00:03:06.094 --> 00:03:07.963
Thanks, everybody, and
have a great weekend.
