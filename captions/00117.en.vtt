00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:10.361
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:11.728
Over the past couple months,

00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:13.328
most of the political
headlines you've read

00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:15.961
have probably been about
the government shutdown

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:18.528
and the launch of
the Affordable Care Act.

00:00:18.528 --> 00:00:20.027
And I know that many
of you have rightly

00:00:20.027 --> 00:00:22.061
never been more
frustrated with Washington.

00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:25.394
But if you look beyond
those headlines,

00:00:25.394 --> 00:00:28.394
there are some good things
happening in our economy.

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:29.828
And that's been my top priority

00:00:29.828 --> 00:00:32.628
since the day I walked
into the Oval Office.

00:00:32.628 --> 00:00:34.394
After decades
in which the middle class

00:00:34.394 --> 00:00:36.761
was working harder and harder 
just to keep up,

00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:39.461
and a punishing recession
that made it worse,

00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:41.328
we made the tough
choices required

00:00:41.328 --> 00:00:42.928
not just to recover from crisis,

00:00:42.928 --> 00:00:44.861
but to rebuild on
a new foundation

00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:48.661
for stronger, more durable
economic growth.

00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:51.728
Five years later,
we have fought our way back.

00:00:51.728 --> 00:00:54.928
Our businesses have created
7.8 million new jobs

00:00:54.928 --> 00:00:56.861
in the past 44 months.

00:00:56.861 --> 00:01:00.895
Another 200,000 Americans
went back to work last month.

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:03.027
The American auto industry
has come roaring back

00:01:03.027 --> 00:01:05.961
with more than
350,000 new jobs -

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:08.361
jobs churning out
and selling the high-tech,

00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:11.528
fuel-efficient cars
the world wants to buy.

00:01:11.528 --> 00:01:14.294
And they're leading the charge
in a manufacturing sector

00:01:14.294 --> 00:01:18.061
that has added jobs for the first time 
since the 1990s -

00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:21.628
a big reason why our businesses 
sell more goods and services

00:01:21.628 --> 00:01:24.561
"Made in America"
than ever before.

00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:26.928
We decided to reverse our
addiction to foreign oil.

00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:30.561
And today, we generate more
renewable energy than ever,

00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:32.728
more natural gas than anybody,

00:01:32.728 --> 00:01:34.861
and for the first time
in nearly 20 years,

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.227
America now produces more oil

00:01:37.227 --> 00:01:40.294
than we buy from
other countries.

00:01:40.294 --> 00:01:43.161
We decided to fix a
broken health care system.

00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:45.061
And even though the
rollout of the marketplace

00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:47.561
where you can buy affordable plans 
has been rough,

00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:50.227
so far, about 500,000
Americans are poised

00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:54.061
to gain health coverage
starting January 1st.

00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:56.294
And by the way,
health care costs are growing

00:01:56.294 --> 00:01:58.528
at the slowest rate in 50 years.

00:01:58.528 --> 00:02:01.895
And one more thing:
since I took office,

00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:04.561
we've cut our deficits
by more than half.

00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:06.695
And that makes
it easier to invest

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:08.628
in the things that create jobs -

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:12.561
education, research,
and infrastructure.

00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:14.761
Imagine how much
farther along we could be

00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:17.294
if both parties
were working together.

00:02:17.294 --> 00:02:19.294
Think about what we
could do if a reckless few

00:02:19.294 --> 00:02:22.194
didn't hold the economy
hostage every few months,

00:02:22.194 --> 00:02:23.895
or waste time on dozens of votes

00:02:23.895 --> 00:02:25.361
to repeal the
Affordable Care Act

00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:28.461
rather than try
to help us fix it.

00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:30.895
In the weeks ahead,
I'll keep talking about my plan

00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:33.494
to build a better bargain
for the middle class.

00:02:33.494 --> 00:02:34.494
Good jobs.

00:02:34.494 --> 00:02:35.795
A good education.

00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:39.294
A chance to buy
a home, save, and retire.

00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:42.695
And yes, the financial security
of affordable health care.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:46.294
And I'll look for any willing
partners who want to help.

00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:48.494
Because of your hard
work and tough sacrifices

00:02:48.494 --> 00:02:49.628
over the past five years,

00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:51.461
we're pointed in
the right direction.

00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:54.227
But we've got more work to
do to keep moving that way.

00:02:54.227 --> 00:02:56.361
And as long as I'm President,

00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:57.795
I'll keep doing
everything I can

00:02:57.795 --> 00:03:00.361
to create jobs,
grow the economy,

00:03:00.361 --> 00:03:03.394
and make sure that
everyone who works hard

00:03:03.394 --> 00:03:05.594
has a chance to get ahead.

00:03:05.594 --> 00:03:07.594
Thanks,
and have a great weekend.
