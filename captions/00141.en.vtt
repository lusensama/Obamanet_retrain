00:00:08.594 --> 00:00:09.994
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:09.994 --> 00:00:11.061
In the next few days,

00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:12.728
America will take
an important step

00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:15.795
towards fixing our broken
immigration system.

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:18.895
The entire United States
Senate will begin debating

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:21.127
a commonsense
immigration reform bill

00:00:21.127 --> 00:00:24.161
that has bipartisan support.

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:27.061
We define ourselves
as a nation of immigrants.

00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:30.194
The promise we find in those
who come from every corner

00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:33.861
of the globe has always been
one of our greatest strengths.

00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:36.961
It's kept our workforce
vibrant and dynamic.

00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:39.294
It's kept our businesses
on the cutting edge.

00:00:39.294 --> 00:00:42.127
And it's helped build the
greatest economic engine

00:00:42.127 --> 00:00:44.027
the world has ever known.

00:00:44.027 --> 00:00:47.628
But for years, our out-of-date
immigration system has actually

00:00:47.628 --> 00:00:51.728
harmed our economy and
threatened our security.

00:00:51.728 --> 00:00:54.261
Now, over the past four years,
we've taken steps

00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:57.461
to try and patch up some of
the worst cracks in the system.

00:00:57.461 --> 00:01:00.027
We strengthened security
on the southern border

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:01.394
by putting more boots
on the ground

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.227
than at any time
in our history.

00:01:03.227 --> 00:01:06.227
And, in part, by using
technology more effectively -

00:01:06.227 --> 00:01:07.594
today, illegal crossings

00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:10.695
are near their lowest
level in decades.

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:12.795
We focused enforcement
efforts on criminals

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:14.695
who are here illegally -

00:01:14.695 --> 00:01:16.461
who endanger our communities -

00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:19.594
and today, we deport more
criminals than ever before.

00:01:19.594 --> 00:01:22.795
And we took up the cause of
"Dreamers," the young people

00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:25.594
who were brought to this
country as children.

00:01:25.594 --> 00:01:29.061
We said that if they're able
to meet certain criteria,

00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:31.227
we'd consider offering
them the chance

00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:34.328
to come out of the shadows 
so they can continue to work here,

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:38.895
and study here, and contribute 
to our communities legally.

00:01:38.895 --> 00:01:41.528
But if we're going to
truly fix a broken system,

00:01:41.528 --> 00:01:44.861
we need Congress to act
in a comprehensive way.

00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:47.795
And that's why what's happening
next week is so important.

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.227
Now, the bill before the
Senate isn't perfect.

00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:52.094
It's a compromise.

00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:54.027
Nobody will get
everything they want -

00:01:54.027 --> 00:01:57.928
not Democrats,
not Republicans, not me.

00:01:57.928 --> 00:02:01.094
But it is a bill that's largely
consistent with the principles

00:02:01.094 --> 00:02:05.394
I've repeatedly laid out for
commonsense immigration reform.

00:02:05.394 --> 00:02:06.594
This bill would continue

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:09.061
to strengthen security
at our borders,

00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:10.127
increase criminal penalties

00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:12.161
against smugglers
and traffickers,

00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:13.795
and hold employers
more accountable

00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:17.428
if they knowingly hire
undocumented workers.

00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:18.828
If enacted, it would represent

00:02:18.828 --> 00:02:22.728
the most ambitious enforcement 
plan in recent memory.

00:02:22.728 --> 00:02:26.094
This bill would provide a
pathway to earned citizenship

00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:27.695
for the 11 million individuals

00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:30.494
who are in this
country illegally -

00:02:30.494 --> 00:02:33.194
a pathway that includes
passing a background check,

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:36.361
learning English,
paying taxes and a penalty,

00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:37.961
and then going to
the back of the line

00:02:37.961 --> 00:02:40.461
behind everyone who's
playing by the rules

00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:42.828
and trying to come here legally.

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:45.795
This bill would modernize the
legal immigration system

00:02:45.795 --> 00:02:48.361
so that, alongside training
American workers

00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:49.895
for the jobs of tomorrow,

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:52.194
we're also attracting
highly-skilled entrepreneurs

00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:55.394
and engineers who will
grow our economy.

00:02:55.394 --> 00:02:57.494
And so that our people don't
have to wait years before their

00:02:57.494 --> 00:03:01.795
loved ones are able to join
them in this country we love.

00:03:01.795 --> 00:03:03.828
That's what immigration
reform looks like.

00:03:03.828 --> 00:03:05.428
Smarter enforcement.

00:03:05.428 --> 00:03:07.628
A pathway to earned citizenship.

00:03:07.628 --> 00:03:10.795
Improvements to the
legal immigration system.

00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:12.695
They're all commonsense steps.

00:03:12.695 --> 00:03:16.027
They've got broad support -
from Republicans and Democrats,

00:03:16.027 --> 00:03:20.761
CEOs and labor leaders,
law enforcement and clergy.

00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:23.261
So there is no reason that
Congress can't work together

00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:27.328
to send a bill to my desk
by the end of the summer.

00:03:27.328 --> 00:03:29.227
We know the opponents of
reform are going to do

00:03:29.227 --> 00:03:31.461
everything they can
to prevent that.

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.194
They'll try to stoke
fear and create division.

00:03:34.194 --> 00:03:36.027
They'll try to play
politics with an issue

00:03:36.027 --> 00:03:39.494
that the vast majority of
Americans want addressed.

00:03:39.494 --> 00:03:43.728
And if they succeed, we will
lose this chance to finally fix

00:03:43.728 --> 00:03:47.061
an immigration system
that is badly broken.

00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:50.494
So if you agree that now is the
time for commonsense reform,

00:03:50.494 --> 00:03:52.795
reach out to your
Representatives.

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:55.294
Tell them we have to get
this done so that everyone

00:03:55.294 --> 00:03:57.528
is playing by the same rules.

00:03:57.528 --> 00:04:00.361
Tell them we have the power to
do this in a way that lives up

00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:02.861
to our traditions as
a nation of laws,

00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:05.127
and a nation of immigrants.

00:04:05.127 --> 00:04:08.127
In the end, that's
what this is all about.

00:04:08.127 --> 00:04:10.628
Men and women who want nothing
more than the chance

00:04:10.628 --> 00:04:13.828
to earn their way into
the American story,

00:04:13.828 --> 00:04:16.695
just like so many of
our ancestors did.

00:04:16.695 --> 00:04:20.161
Throughout our history,
that has only made us stronger.

00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:21.428
And it's how we'll make sure

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:25.194
that America's best days
always lie ahead.

00:04:25.194 --> 00:04:26.027
Thanks.

00:04:26.027 --> 00:04:27.328
And have a great weekend.
