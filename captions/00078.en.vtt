00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.311
The President:
Over the past week,

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:14.848
the United States has continued
to lead our friends and allies

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.684
in the strategy to degrade
and ultimately destroy

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.453
the terrorist group
known as ISIL.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.455
As I've said before, our
intelligence community

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.824
has not yet detected
specific plots from these

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:26.626
terrorists against America.

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:30.029
Right now, they pose a threat
to the people of Iraq, Syria,

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.931
and the broader Middle East.

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.934
But its leaders have threatened
America and our allies.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.771
And if left unchecked, they
could pose a growing threat

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.773
to the United States.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.041
So, last month, I gave the
order for our military

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:45.445
to begin taking targeted
action against ISIL.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:48.047
Since then, American pilots
have flown more than

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:51.718
170 airstrikes against
these terrorists in Iraq.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:55.221
And France has now joined
us in these airstrikes.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.991
Going forward, we won't hesitate
to take action against these

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:00.660
terrorists in Iraq or in Syria.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.596
But this is not
America's fight alone.

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:05.865
I won't commit our troops to
fighting another ground war

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.534
in Iraq, or in Syria.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:10.870
It's more effective to use our
capabilities to help partners

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.340
on the ground secure their
own country's futures.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.842
We will use our air power.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:17.911
We will train and
equip our partners.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.246
We will advise and
we will assist.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.615
And we'll lead a broad
coalition of nations who

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.951
have a stake in this fight.

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:26.119
This isn't America vs.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.120
ISIL.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.122
This is the people
of that region vs.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.223
ISIL.

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:32.926
It's the world vs ISIL.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.361
We've been working to secure
bipartisan support for this

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.864
strategy here at home, because I
believe that we are strongest

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:40.166
as a nation when the President
and Congress work together.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.902
We've been consulting
closely with Congress.

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:44.904
And last week, Secretary
of State Kerry,

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:48.074
Secretary of Defense Hagel,
and military leaders worked

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:50.743
to gain their support
for our strategy.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:53.046
A majority of Democrats and
a majority of Republicans

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:55.882
in both the House and the Senate
have now approved a first,

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:58.785
key part of our strategy
by wide margins.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.221
They've given our troops the
authority they need to train

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.957
Syrian opposition fighters
so that they can fight

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.959
ISIL in Syria.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.928
Those votes sent a powerful
signal to the world:

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:11.064
Americans are united in
confronting this danger.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:14.367
And I hope Congress continues to
make sure our troops get what

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:17.003
they need to get the job done.

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:19.005
Meanwhile, because we're
leading the right way,

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:21.508
more nations are
joining our coalition.

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:23.977
Over 40 countries have offered
to help the broad campaign

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:27.213
against ISIL so far - from
training and equipment,

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:30.750
to humanitarian relief, to
flying combat missions.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.852
And this week, at
the United Nations,

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:35.188
I'll continue to rally the
world against this threat.

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:39.526
This is an effort that America
has the unique ability to lead.

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:43.396
When the world is threatened;
when the world needs help;

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.265
it calls on America.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:47.400
And we call on our troops.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.836
Whether it's to degrade and
ultimately destroy a group

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.672
of terrorists, or to contain
and combat a threat like

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:56.242
the Ebola epidemic in Africa;
we ask a lot of our troops.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:59.379
But while our politics
may be divided at times,

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.081
the American people stand
united around supporting

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.850
our troops and
their families.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.719
This is a moment of
American leadership.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.256
Thanks to them, it is
a moment we will meet.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.257
Thank you.
