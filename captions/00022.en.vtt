00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.644
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.047
For decades, too many
working Americans went

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:16.649
without the security of
health insurance -- and

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.853
their financial well-being
suffered because of it.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.821
We've begun to change that.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.257
As the Affordable Care
Act has taken effect,

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:28.528
we've covered 17.6
million Americans.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:34.267
Since 2010, the uninsured
rate has decreased by 45%.

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:37.003
And for the first time, more
than 90% of Americans

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.738
are covered.

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.774
If you haven't
gotten covered yet,

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.276
or if you care about someone
who hasn't gotten covered

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:45.712
yet, now's your chance.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.647
It's open enrollment season
for

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:50.417
the Health Insurance Marketplace.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.585
What that means is,
with a few clicks on

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.989
HealthCare.gov, you'll find
private insurance companies

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.158
competing for your business.

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:00.860
You can compare plans and
choose the one that's right

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.662
for your family.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:05.165
In fact, most Americans will
find an option that costs

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:08.268
less than $75 a month.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.003
Even if you already have
insurance through

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.172
the Marketplace, check it out.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:15.175
Shopping around can save you
a lot of money -- last year,

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:19.779
consumers who shopped
saved almost $400.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.915
Take the story of a
man named Phil Viso,

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.083
who emailed me
earlier this year.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:27.153
Phil's a software developer
from my hometown of Chicago.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:30.023
Last winter, he had an idea
for a new app and decided to

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:31.724
start his own company.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.460
And that can be scary when
you need to get

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.261
your own health insurance.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.497
But Phil logged on
to HealthCare.gov,

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:40.099
answered a few
questions, picked a plan,

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.203
and even found out he was
eligible for a tax credit

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:44.704
that saved him money.

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:47.574
Here's what he wrote: "I'm
still sort of in shock about

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:50.410
how great the experience of
signing up for health care

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.546
was...I will have a lot to
worry about over the course

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:56.316
of the year as I try
to get my app released,

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:59.085
but thankfully, good health
care will not be one of

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:00.954
those worries."

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:03.456
After he sent me that email,
Phil ended up getting a new

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.158
and better job anyway.

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:07.627
But that's the whole
point of health insurance.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.195
Peace of mind.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.997
And under the
Affordable Care Act,

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:14.033
if you want to change
jobs, go back to school,

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:17.170
or chase that new idea, you
can do it without worrying

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.873
about going broke
if you get sick.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:22.775
If you've got a pre-existing
condition -- diabetes or

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:27.580
cancer or heartburn or a
heart attack -- you can no

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.217
longer be charged more
or denied coverage.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:34.487
You can no longer be charged
more just for being a woman.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.923
And preventive care like
checkups and immunizations

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:40.393
now come with no additional
out-of-pocket costs.

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:43.463
What we're talking about
is no longer just a law,

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.932
and it's certainly not the
myths and scare tactics that

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.735
the cynics have peddled
our way for years.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:49.869
This is reality.

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.671
This is health
care in America.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.173
And the bottom line
is, Americans like it.

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:55.241
They're happy with their plans

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.443
and they are happy with their premiums.

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:58.545
So join them.

00:02:58.545 --> 00:02:59.913
Give it a shot.

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:04.450
Check out HealthCare.gov,
CuidadoDeSalud.gov,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:12.225
or call 1-800-318-2596 to
find a plan that's right for

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:15.028
you or someone
you care about.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.263
And by the way -- if you
live in one of the 20 cities

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:19.566
participating in our Healthy
Communities Challenge,

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.167
I want to see how many of
your neighbors

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:22.735
you can get signed up.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.637
I'll come visit the city
that enrolls the highest

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:27.774
percentage of folks who
aren't covered right now.

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.475
That's a promise.

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:32.478
After all, this country is
at its best when we look out

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:33.546
for each other.

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.214
And together, we can help
more Americans get the

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:38.918
security that they and
their families deserve.

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:40.119
Thanks everybody.

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:42.855
Have a great weekend.
