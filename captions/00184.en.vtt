00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:07.000
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.367
I'm here in Ohio, where I've
spent the past couple of days

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:12.834
talking with folks about our
central challenge as a country

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:16.166
-- not just reclaiming all
the jobs lost to the recession,

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.200
but reclaiming the economic
security that so many Americans

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.867
have lost over the last decade.

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:24.734
Our mission isn't just to
put people back to work --

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:28.367
it's to rebuild an economy
where that work pays;

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:31.100
an economy in which everyone
who works hard has the chance to

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.767
get ahead.

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:35.600
For months, we've been pushing
Congress to pass several

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.734
common-sense ideas that
will help us do that.

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:41.433
And on Friday, I signed into law
a bill that will do two things

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:43.266
for the American people.

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:46.867
First, it will keep thousands of
construction workers on the job

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:49.433
rebuilding our nation's
infrastructure.

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:52.667
Second, it will keep interest
rates on federal student loans

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:55.700
from doubling this year -- which
would have hit more than seven

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.100
million students with about a
thousand dollars more on their

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.900
loan payments.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.900
Those steps will make a real
difference in the lives of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.567
millions of Americans.

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:07.767
But make no mistake:
we've got more to do.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.266
The construction industry was
hit brutally hard when the

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.800
housing bubble burst.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.633
So it's not enough to just keep
construction workers on the job

00:01:14.633 --> 00:01:17.066
doing projects that
were already underway.

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.600
For months, I've been calling on
Congress to take half the money

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.367
we're no longer spending on
war and use it to do some

00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:24.433
nation-building here at home.

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:27.166
There's work to be done
building roads and bridges and

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.667
wireless networks.

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:30.734
And there are hundreds of
thousands of construction

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:32.800
workers ready to do it.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.266
The same thing is
true for our students.

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.734
The bill I'm about to sign is
vital for millions of students

00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:39.000
and their families.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.667
But it's not enough to just
keep their student loan rates

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:43.100
from doubling.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.900
For months, I've been calling
on Congress to reform and expand

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.900
the financial aid that's
offered to students.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.567
I've been asking them to help us
give two million Americans the

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:55.033
opportunity to learn the skills
that businesses in their area

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:58.300
are looking for -- right now --
through partnerships between

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.033
community colleges
and employers.

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:04.734
In America, a higher education
cannot be a luxury reserved for

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:06.900
just a few privileged people.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.133
It's an economic necessity that
every American family should be

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:11.934
able to afford.

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:14.500
Finally, I want to thank every
American who took the time to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.467
sit down and write a
letter, or type an e-mail,

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:20.500
or make a phone call or send a
tweet hoping your voice would

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.867
make a difference.

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:25.200
I promise you -- your voice
made all the difference.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.033
And as long as I have the
privilege of being your

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:31.266
President, your voice will
be heard in the White House.

00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:33.500
So thanks, and have
a great weekend.
