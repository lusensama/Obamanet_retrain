00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.511
The President: Hi everybody.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.447
As president, I spend most of my
time focused on what we can do

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:18.551
to grow the economy and grow
new pathways of opportunity for

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.653
Americans like you to get ahead.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.756
And we've made progress.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:26.400
More than 12 million new private
sector jobs in the past five years.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:29.600
More than 16 million Americans
who have gained health insurance.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.265
More jobs creating
more clean energy.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.402
More kids graduating from high
school and college than ever

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.103
before.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:40.173
But in a relentlessly
changing economy,

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:42.175
we've still got more work to do.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.044
And one of things we should
be doing, for example,

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:48.848
is re-writing the rules of
global trade to benefit American

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:51.418
workers and American businesses.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:55.188
I think we should write those
rules before China does.

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:58.324
That's why I've been working
with Congress to pass new 21st

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:01.294
Century Trade Agreements with
standards that are higher and

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:05.565
protections that are tougher
than any past trade agreement.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.268
I believe it's the right thing
to do for American workers and

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:11.171
families or I
wouldn't be doing it.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:14.340
I believe it's what will give us
the competitive edge in a new

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.443
economy or I would
not be doing it.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:21.314
Now, several members
of Congress disagree.

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:23.316
That's why it's still
tied up there with there,

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:26.319
along with a lot of other good
ideas that would create jobs.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.522
And eventually, I'm optimistic
we'll get this done.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:32.058
But America does
not stand still.

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:35.061
And that's why on issue after
issue where Congress has failed

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:38.064
to act, my administration has
partnered with mayors and

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:41.401
governors across the country to
advance economic priorities that

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:45.305
most working families in America
are in favor of doing right now.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.407
And we've had success.

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:51.711
Over the past couple of years,
17 states and 6 major cities

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.180
have raised the minimum
wage for their workers.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.716
19 cities have enacted
paid sick days.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.352
And five states have
enacted paid sick days

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:01.488
or paid family leave.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:05.191
34 states increased
funding for quality pre-K.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:08.995
And 19 cities and states have
signed up for our new TechHire

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:11.397
initiative to train
workers for the high wage,

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:14.934
high skill jobs of tomorrow;
the kind of jobs that new trade

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.437
deals would help create.

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:19.439
Some of these victories
have been small.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.907
Some have been quiet.

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:23.676
But they've added up to a big
difference for working families

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.345
across America.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:28.414
And that's what
matters to me the most.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:30.583
Because it matters to you.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:33.686
On Friday, I talked about
these initiatives and more

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:36.322
in a speech to the U.S.
Conference of Mayors.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.058
Check it out at
whitehouse.gov.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.761
Some of it might
matter to your city.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.630
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
