00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:08.433
The President:
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:10.200
Earlier this week, the
Republican House

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.767
of Representatives chose to shut
down a government they don't

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:16.667
like over a health care
law they don't like.

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:19.233
And I've talked a lot about the
real-world consequences of this

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:23.300
shutdown in recent days - the
services disrupted; the benefits

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.433
delayed; the public servants
kicked off the job without pay.

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:31.333
But today, I want to let the
Americans dealing with those

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.967
real-world consequences
have their say.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.767
And these are just a few of the
many heartbreaking letters

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:39.233
I've gotten from them in the
past couple weeks -

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:43.667
including more than 30,000 over
the past few days.

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:46.767
Kelly Mumper lives
in rural Alabama.

00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:50.133
She works in early education,
and has three kids of her

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.166
own in the Marines.

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:55.800
Here's what she wrote
to me on Wednesday.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.500
"Our Head Start agency was
forced to stop providing

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.834
services on October 1st for over
770 children,

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:06.300
and 175 staff were furloughed.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.266
I am extremely concerned for
the welfare of these children.

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.100
There are parents who work
and who attend school.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.333
Where are they leaving their
children...is it a safe

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:19.734
environment...are they getting
the food that they receive

00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:22.800
at their Head Start program?"

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.400
On the day Julia Pruden's
application to buy a home for

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.467
her and her special needs
children was approved by the

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:31.934
USDA's rural development direct
loan program, she wrote

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:36.333
me from Minot, North Dakota.

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:39.600
"We put in an offer to purchase
a home this weekend, and it was

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.033
accepted...if funding does not
go through, our chances of the

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:47.433
American Dream are down the
drain...We have worked really

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:49.467
hard to get our credit to
be acceptable to purchase

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:53.266
a home...if it weren't for the
direct lending program provided

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:56.233
by the USDA, we would not
qualify to buy

00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:58.633
the home we found."

00:01:58.633 --> 00:02:00.533
These are just two of the many
letters I've received from

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:04.000
people who work hard; try to
make ends meet;

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.767
try to do right by their families.

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:09.633
They're military or military
spouses who've seen commissaries

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:12.000
closed on their bases.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.834
They're veterans worried the
services they've

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:15.633
earned won't be there.

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:17.633
They're business owners who've
seen their contracts with

00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:19.633
the government put on hold,
worried they'll have

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:21.700
to let people go.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.300
I want them to know, I read
the stories you share with me.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.834
These are our fellow Americans.

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:30.567
These are the people who
sent us here to serve.

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:34.033
And I know that Republicans in
the House of Representatives are

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:37.433
hearing the same
kinds of stories, too.

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:40.433
As I made clear to them this
week, there's only one way out

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:44.000
of this reckless and damaging
shutdown: pass a budget that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
funds our government, with
no partisan strings attached.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.834
The Senate has
already done this.

00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:53.500
And there are enough Republican
and Democratic votes in the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.633
House of Representatives willing
to do the same,

00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:59.900
and end this shutdown immediately.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.367
Unfortunately the far right of
the Republican Party won't let

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:06.567
Speaker Boehner give
that bill a yes-or-no vote.

00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:07.934
Take that vote.

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:09.367
Stop this farce.

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:11.800
End this shutdown now.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.367
The American people don't get
to demand ransom in exchange

00:03:14.367 --> 00:03:16.800
for doing their job.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.633
Neither does Congress.

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:21.433
They don't get to hold our
democracy or our economy hostage

00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:24.200
over a settled law.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.667
They don't get to kick a child
out of Head Start if they don't

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:29.767
agree to take her parents'
health insurance away.

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:33.233
That's not how our democracy
is supposed to work.

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.200
That's why I won't pay a ransom
in exchange

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.934
for reopening the government.

00:03:36.934 --> 00:03:38.500
And I certainly won't pay a
ransom in exchange

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.266
for raising the debt ceiling.

00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:44.300
For as reckless as a government
shutdown is, an economic

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.567
shutdown that comes with default, 
with America not paying

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:51.834
its bills, would be dramatically worse.

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:55.133
I'll always work with anyone
of either party on ways to grow

00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:57.834
this economy, create new jobs,
and get our fiscal house

00:03:57.834 --> 00:04:00.200
in order for the long haul.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.300
But not under the shadow of
these threats to our economy.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.200
So my message is simple.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.700
Pass a budget.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.200
End this government shutdown.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.800
Pay our bills.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.467
Prevent an economic shutdown.

00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:17.600
These Americans and millions of
others are counting on Congress

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.533
to do the right thing.

00:04:19.533 --> 00:04:23.633
And I will do everything I
can to make sure they do.

00:04:23.633 --> 00:04:25.500
Thanks.
