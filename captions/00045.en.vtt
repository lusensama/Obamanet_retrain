00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.544
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.280
As President and Commander
in Chief, my greatest

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.684
responsibility is the safety
of the American people.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.420
And in our fight against
terrorists, we need to use

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.124
every effective tool at our
disposal -- both to defend

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:27.227
our security and to protect
the freedoms and civil

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:30.730
liberties enshrined
in our Constitution.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.300
But tomorrow -- Sunday, at
midnight -- some important

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.837
tools we use against
terrorists will expire.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.273
That's because Congress
has not renewed them, and

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:44.210
because legislation that
would -- the USA Freedom Act

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.445
-- is stuck in the Senate.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:49.616
I want to be very clear
about what this means.

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:52.585
Today, when investigating
terrorist networks, our

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.587
national security
professionals can seek a

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.891
court order to obtain
certain business records.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.026
Our law enforcement
professionals can seek a

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.529
roving wiretap to keep up
with terrorists when they

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.464
switch cell phones.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:08.067
We can seek a wiretap on
so-called lone wolves --

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.970
suspected terrorists who may
not be directly tied to a

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.806
terrorist group.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:15.575
These tools are
not controversial.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:19.212
Since 9/11, they have been
renewed numerous times.

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:22.215
FBI Director James Comey
says they are "essential"

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:25.685
and that losing them would
"severely" impact terrorism

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:27.353
investigations.

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.789
But if Congress doesn't act
by tomorrow at midnight,

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.091
these tools go away as well.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.928
The USA Freedom Act also
accomplishes something I

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:38.431
called for a year and a
half ago: it ends the bulk

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.901
metadata program -- the bulk
collection of phone records

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.704
-- as it currently exists
and puts in place new

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:46.105
reforms.

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:48.875
The government will no
longer hold these records;

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.710
telephone providers will.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.279
The Act also includes other
changes to our surveillance

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.915
laws -- including more
transparency -- to help

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.585
build confidence among the
American people that your

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:02.055
privacy and civil liberties
are being protected.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:05.592
But if Congress doesn't act
by midnight tomorrow, these

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.594
reforms will be
in jeopardy, too.

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:10.196
It doesn't have
to be this way.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:12.732
The USA Freedom Act
reflects ideas from privacy

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:15.702
advocates, our private
sector partners and our

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.737
national security experts.

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:20.640
It already passed the House
of Representatives with

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.410
overwhelming bipartisan
support -- Republicans and

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.412
Democrats.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.483
A majority of the Senate --
Republicans and Democrats --

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:33.186
have voted to
move it forward.

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:34.954
So what's the problem?

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:37.724
A small group of senators
is standing in the way.

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:40.593
And, unfortunately, some
folks are trying to use this

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.929
debate to score
political points.

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:46.432
But this shouldn't and
can't be about politics.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.935
This is a matter of
national security.

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:51.538
Terrorists like al Qaeda and
ISIL aren't suddenly going

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:54.440
to stop plotting against
us at midnight tomorrow.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.809
And we shouldn't surrender
the tools that help keep us

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:57.944
safe.

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:59.746
It would be irresponsible.

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:00.813
It would be reckless.

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:03.583
And we shouldn't
allow it to happen.

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.752
So today, I'm calling on
Americans to join me in

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:08.655
speaking with one
voice to the Senate.

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:10.356
Put the politics aside.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.825
Put our national
security first.

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:15.295
Pass the USA
Freedom Act -- now.

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:18.231
And let's protect the
security and civil liberties

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:20.166
of every American.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.134
Thanks very much.
