00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.344
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.780
Over the next couple weeks,
schools all across the country

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.815
will be opening their doors.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:18.651
Students will suit up for
fall sports, marching band,

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.421
and the school play; moms
and dads will snap those

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.723
first-day-of-school pictures
-- and that includes

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:25.125
me and Michelle.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.293
And so today, I want to talk
directly with students

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.429
and parents about one of the
most important things any

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.298
of you can do this year --
and that's to begin preparing

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:36.002
yourself for an education
beyond high school.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.605
We know that in today's economy,
whether you go to a four-year

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:41.808
college, a community college, or
a professional training program,

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:44.878
some higher education
is the surest ticket

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.579
to the middle class.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.815
The typical American with a
bachelor's degree or higher

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:53.286
earns over $28,000 more per
year than someone with just

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:54.821
a high school diploma.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.890
And they're also much
more likely to have a job

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.626
in the first place -- the
unemployment rate for those

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:02.529
with a bachelor's degree
is less than one-third

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:06.266
of the rate for those without
a high school diploma.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.935
But for too many families
across the country,

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:12.605
paying for higher education
is a constant struggle.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:15.508
Earlier this year, a young woman
named Elizabeth Cooper wrote

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:17.977
to tell me how hard it is
for middle-class families

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:20.747
like hers to afford college.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.983
As she said, she feels "not
significant enough to be

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.386
addressed, not poor enough
for people to worry about,

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:30.323
and not rich enough
to be cared about."

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:33.159
Michelle and I know the feeling
-- we only finished paying off

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.161
our student loans ten years ago.

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.931
And so as President, I'm working
to make sure young people

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:40.600
like Elizabeth can go to
college without racking

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.635
up mountains of debt.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:45.338
We reformed a student loan
system so that more money

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:47.974
goes to students
instead of big banks.

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:50.143
We expanded grants and
college tax credits

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:51.878
for students and families.

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:54.781
We took action to offer millions
of students a chance to cap

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.617
their student loan payments
at 10 percent of their income.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:01.387
And Congress should pass a bill
to let students refinance

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:04.157
their loans at today's
lower interest rates,

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:07.260
just like their parents can
refinance their mortgage.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.696
But as long as college
costs keep rising,

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:12.532
we can't just keep throwing
money at the problem --

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:15.268
colleges have to do their part
to bring down costs as well.

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:19.739
That's why we proposed a plan
to tie federal financial aid

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.076
to a college's performance, and
create a new college scorecard

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:26.246
so that students and parents
can see which schools provide

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:28.414
the biggest bang for your buck.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:32.118
We launched a new $75 million
challenge to inspire colleges

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:35.088
to reduce costs and raise
graduation rates.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:38.958
And in January, more than 100
college presidents and nonprofit

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.494
leaders came to the White
House and made commitments

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:45.598
to increase opportunities
for underserved students.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.835
Since then, we've met with even
more leaders who want to create

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.772
new community-based partnerships
and support school counselors.

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:56.409
And this week, my Secretary
of Education, Arne Duncan,

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.145
announced a series of
commitments to support students

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:03.149
who need a little extra academic
help getting through college.

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.451
This is a challenge
I take personally.

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:07.787
And to all you young people,
now that you're heading

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:10.790
back to school, your education
is something you have

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.625
to take personally, also.

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:15.295
It's up to you to push
yourself; to take hard classes

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.630
and read challenging books.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.933
Science shows that when you
struggle to solve a problem

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:21.935
or make a new argument,
you're actually forming

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:24.037
new connections in your brain.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.173
So when you're thinking hard,
you're getting smarter.

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:30.209
Which means this year, challenge
yourself to reach higher.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.580
And set your sights on
college in the years ahead.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.249
Your country is counting on you.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:39.419
And don't forget to have
some fun along the way, too.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.687
Thanks everybody.

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:41.888
Good luck on the year ahead.
