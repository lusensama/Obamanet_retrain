00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.333
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.200
On Thursday,
I addressed a conference

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.333
for business leaders
from around the world.

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:15.500
And my pitch was simple:
Choose America.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.333
Invest in America.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.200
Create jobs in America.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.033
It speaks to my top priority as
President: growing our economy,

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:26.667
creating good jobs,
strengthening security

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:29.600
and opportunity for
the middle class.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.266
Over the past three
and a half years,

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.800
our businesses
have created over

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.700
seven and a half
million new jobs.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.600
And this week,
the Treasury confirmed

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.934
that since I took office,

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:41.266
we've cut our deficits
by more than half.

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:44.533
But we have more work to do.

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:48.200
We need to grow and create
more good jobs faster.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.500
That's my driving focus.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.533
And I'll go anywhere and do
anything to make it happen.

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.433
That has to be Washington's
driving focus as well.

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:58.266
But I know that what you
often hear out of Washington

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:01.166
can sound like
Charlie Brown's teacher -

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.767
a jumble of unfocused noise

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:05.000
that's out of touch with
the things you care about.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.500
So today, I want to cut through
that noise and talk plainly

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.934
about what we should do right
now to keep growing this economy

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:12.900
and creating new jobs.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.033
It begins by ending what has
done more than anything else

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:18.633
to undermine our economy
over the past few years -

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:21.800
and that's the constant
cycle of manufactured crises

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.934
and self-inflicted wounds.

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:25.300
I was glad to hear
the Republican leader

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.467
in the Senate say this week

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:28.533
that they won't pursue
another government shutdown

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.900
or threaten another
default on our debt.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.633
Because we shouldn't be injuring
ourselves every few months -

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:37.333
we should be investing
in ourselves.

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.333
And one way to do that
is through the budget

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:42.166
that Congress started
working on this week.

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.533
Now, budgets can
be a boring topic -

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:45.600
especially on the weekend.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.400
But they can also be revealing.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.633
Because they expose what
our priorities are as a country

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.667
for all to see.

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:54.734
Think about it.

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:56.934
We can keep wasteful
corporate tax giveaways

00:01:56.934 --> 00:01:58.834
that working folks don't get -

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:01.667
or we could close those
loopholes and use that money

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:04.533
to pay for things
that actually create jobs.

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:07.533
We can keep harmful cuts
to education programs -

00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:09.767
or we could give more
kids a head start,

00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:11.867
hire more teachers
in math and science,

00:02:11.867 --> 00:02:15.467
and help more kids
afford a college education.

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:18.367
We can keep doling out corporate
welfare to big oil companies -

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:20.867
or we could keep investing
in the renewable energy

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:24.467
that creates jobs and lowers
our carbon pollution.

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:25.767
Priorities.

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:26.900
Choices.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.734
That's what this is about.

00:02:28.734 --> 00:02:31.500
And the stakes for the middle
class couldn't be higher.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.767
If we don't pick the
right priorities now,

00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:36.433
make the right choices now,
we could hinder growth

00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:39.233
and opportunity for decades,
and leave our children

00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:40.700
with something less.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.000
That includes the
obsession with cutting

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.066
just for the sake of cutting.

00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:48.800
That hasn't helped our economy
grow; it's held it back.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.300
Remember, our deficits are
getting smaller - not bigger.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.834
On my watch, they're falling at
the fastest pace in 60 years.

00:02:56.834 --> 00:03:00.433
So that gives us room to
fix our long-term debt problems

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:02.166
without sticking
it to young people,

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:04.900
or undermining
our bedrock retirement

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.800
and health security programs,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.834
or cutting basic research
that helps the economy grow.

00:03:10.834 --> 00:03:12.333
Here's the bottom line.

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:15.433
Congress should pass a budget
that cuts things we don't need,

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:17.800
and closes wasteful
tax loopholes

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.834
that don't help create jobs,

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:22.133
so that we can free up
resources for the things

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:25.300
that actually do create
jobs and growth.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.934
Building new roads,
and bridges,

00:03:27.934 --> 00:03:31.066
and schools, and airports -
that creates jobs.

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:34.400
Educating our kids and our
workers for a global economy -

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.767
that helps us grow.

00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:41.133
Investing in science,
technology, and research -

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:43.033
that keeps our businesses
and our military

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:44.033
on the cutting edge.

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:46.767
It's vital for our
economic future.

00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:48.133
So the question
isn't between growth

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:50.033
and fiscal responsibility.

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:51.533
We need both.

00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:54.333
The question can't be
how much more we can cut;

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:57.767
it's got to be how many
more jobs we can create,

00:03:57.767 --> 00:03:59.867
how many more kids
we can educate,

00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:04.133
and how much more shared
prosperity we can generate.

00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:07.367
Because in America, our economy
doesn't grow from the top-down.

00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:08.934
It grows from
the middle-class out.

00:04:08.934 --> 00:04:12.834
And as long as I am President,
our national mission will remain

00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:15.266
building an America
where everyone belongs,

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:19.934
and everyone who works hard
has a chance to get ahead.

00:04:19.934 --> 00:04:21.934
Thanks,
and have a great weekend.
