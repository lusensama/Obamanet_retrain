00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:08.700
The President:
At this moment, our nation
is facing a host of big and

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.433
difficult challenges.

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:12.767
And more than anything else,
what's required to meet those

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:16.066
challenges right now is a sense
of cooperation and common

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.233
purpose among our leaders.

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:20.734
What we need is a willingness in
Washington to put the public's

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:24.633
interests first -- a willingness to score fewer political points

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:27.600
so that we can start
solving more problems.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.467
That's why I was disappointed
this week to see a dreary and

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:33.333
familiar politics get in the way
of our ability to move forward

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.000
on a series of critical issues
that have a direct impact on

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.600
people's lives.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.700
In the United States Senate,
we have legislation that would

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.767
boost our economic recovery
and help Americans who've been

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:46.600
affected by the worst
recession in generations.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.066
We've certainly made progress since we were losing 750,000

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:53.100
jobs per month around
the time I took office.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.400
Our economy is growing again,
and we've added jobs for five straight months.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.900
But there are still millions
of Americans out of work,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.700
and millions more who are
struggling to pay the bills.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.166
The legislation in the Senate
right now would extend

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:08.300
unemployment benefits to those
workers who lost their job

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.667
through no fault of their own.

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:12.633
It would provide relief to
struggling states that would

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:17.600
help save the jobs of thousands
of teachers and cops and firefighters.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.633
There are also provisions in
this legislation that would

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:22.867
extend the tax credit for
first-time homebuyers,

00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:26.166
as well as tax cuts to keep
research and development jobs

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.533
here in the United States.

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.900
Unfortunately, the Republican
leadership in the Senate won't

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.500
even allow this legislation
to come up for a vote.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.567
And if this
obstruction continues,

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:39.934
unemployed Americans will
see their benefits stop.

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:42.633
Teachers and firefighters
will lose their jobs.

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:45.633
Families will pay more
for their first home.

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:48.600
All we ask for is a
simple up or down vote.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.834
That's what the
American people deserve.

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:53.266
Just like they deserve an up or
down vote on legislation that

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:55.867
would hold oil companies
accountable for the disasters

00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:59.400
they cause -- a vote that's
also being blocked by the

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.800
Republican leadership
in the Senate.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.667
Right now, the law places a $75
million cap on the amount oil

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.867
companies must pay to families
and small businesses who suffer

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:11.800
economic losses as a result
of a spill like the one we're

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.834
witnessing in the Gulf Coast.

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:15.567
We should remove that cap.

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:19.767
But the Republican leadership
won't even allow a debate or a vote.

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:24.467
And as we speak today, 136 men
and women who I've nominated for

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:27.767
key positions in the federal
government are still awaiting a

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:30.100
vote on the floor of the Senate.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.200
All are highly qualified.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.467
Very few are controversial.

00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:37.967
The vast majority already have
support from both parties.

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:40.900
But most of them are seeing
their nominations intentionally

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.633
delayed by Republican leaders,
or even blocked altogether.

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:46.734
They cannot get a vote.

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:49.467
What this means is that, at
a moment when our country is

00:02:49.467 --> 00:02:52.867
facing so many challenges -- a time when we need all hands on

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:56.700
deck -- we can't get the qualified people we need to

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.333
start the jobs they
were appointed to do.

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:02.867
Look, the nature of our
democracy is that we'll always

00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:05.900
have disagreements and
debates -- even heated ones.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.066
That's healthy and
it's important.

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:10.100
But let's argue over
genuine differences --

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.066
over ideas and policies.

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.934
And let's go into those
debates with an open mind --

00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:18.400
a willingness to find common
ground and a conviction that,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.600
in the end, one way or another,
we'll have a vote to decide them.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.266
Next week, I'll be meeting with
a bipartisan group of Senators

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:29.200
to discuss how we can transition
away from our dependence on

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.100
fossil fuels and embrace
a clean energy future.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.400
I don't expect that we'll agree
on a solution right away.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.900
In fact, I know that there will
be plenty of disagreement and

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.433
different ideas.

00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:43.133
But at least it shows that
Republicans and Democrats can

00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:46.033
still sit down together in
an attempt to tackle the big

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:48.400
challenges facing our nation.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.266
I know the political season
is upon us in Washington.

00:03:51.266 --> 00:03:55.633
But gridlock as a political
strategy is destructive to the country.

00:03:55.633 --> 00:03:57.934
Whether we are Democrats
or Republicans,

00:03:57.934 --> 00:04:00.767
we've got an obligation that
goes beyond caring about the

00:04:00.767 --> 00:04:02.433
next election.

00:04:02.433 --> 00:04:05.200
We have an obligation to care
for the next generation.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.633
So I hope that when
Congress returns next week,

00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:11.900
they'll do so with a greater spirit of compromise and cooperation.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.734
America will be watching.

00:04:13.734 --> 00:04:14.800
Thanks.
