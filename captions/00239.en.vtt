00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:11.294
President Obama:
This week, I went to
Memphis, Tennessee,

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:12.928
where I spoke to the
graduating class of

00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:15.494
Booker T. Washington
High School.

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:17.728
Graduations are always
happy occasions.

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:20.928
But this commencement was
especially hopeful --

00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:23.895
because of just how much the kids at Booker T. Washington

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:26.494
High School had overcome.

00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:28.761
This is a school in the middle
of a tough neighborhood in

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.294
South Memphis.

00:00:30.294 --> 00:00:31.795
There's a lot of crime.

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:33.628
There's a lot of poverty.

00:00:33.628 --> 00:00:36.695
And just a few years ago, only
about half of the students at

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:38.795
the school graduated.

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:41.895
Just a handful went off
to college each year.

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:44.494
But folks came together
to change all that.

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:47.227
Under the leadership of a
dynamic principal and devoted

00:00:47.227 --> 00:00:50.795
teachers, they started special
academies for ninth graders --

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:54.961
because they found that that's
when a lot of kids were lost.

00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:57.761
They made it possible for
students to take AP classes or

00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:59.961
vocational courses.

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:03.328
Most importantly, they didn't
just change the curriculum;

00:01:03.328 --> 00:01:06.928
they created a culture that
prizes hard work and discipline,

00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:10.361
and that shows every
student that they matter.

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:14.494
Today, four out of five students
at the school earn a diploma.

00:01:14.494 --> 00:01:18.461
70% continue their education,
many the first in their families

00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:20.094
to go to college.

00:01:20.094 --> 00:01:23.294
So Booker T. Washington High
School is no longer a story

00:01:23.294 --> 00:01:25.828
about what's gone
wrong in education.

00:01:25.828 --> 00:01:28.695
It's a story about how
we can set it right.

00:01:28.695 --> 00:01:32.661
We need to encourage this kind
of change all across America.

00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:35.394
We need to reward the reforms
that are driven not by

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:39.628
Washington, but by principals
and teachers and parents.

00:01:39.628 --> 00:01:42.027
That's how we'll make
progress in education --

00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:44.994
not from the top down,
but from the bottom up.

00:01:44.994 --> 00:01:47.728
And that's the guiding principle
of the Race to the Top

00:01:47.728 --> 00:01:51.294
competition my administration
started two years ago.

00:01:51.294 --> 00:01:55.494
The idea is simple: if states
show that they're serious about

00:01:55.494 --> 00:01:58.628
reform, we'll show
them the money.

00:01:58.628 --> 00:01:59.961
And it's already making
a difference throughout

00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:01.861
the country.

00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:03.795
In Tennessee, where
I met those students,

00:02:03.795 --> 00:02:06.994
they've launched an innovative
residency program so that new

00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:10.461
teachers can be mentored
by veteran educators.

00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:13.227
In Oregon, Michigan,
and elsewhere,

00:02:13.227 --> 00:02:16.061
grants are supporting the work
of teachers who are lengthening

00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:19.328
the school day, offering
more specialized classes,

00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:23.561
and making the changes necessary
to improve struggling schools.

00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:26.961
Our challenge now is to allow
all 50 states to benefit from

00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:29.328
the success of Race to the Top.

00:02:29.328 --> 00:02:31.861
We need to promote reform that
gets results while encouraging

00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:34.828
communities to figure out
what's best for their kids.

00:02:34.828 --> 00:02:38.094
That why it's so important that
Congress replace No Child Left

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:42.994
Behind this year -- so
schools have that flexibility.

00:02:42.994 --> 00:02:45.661
Reform just can't wait.

00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:48.094
And if anyone doubts this,
they ought to head to Booker T.

00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:49.961
Washington High.

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.428
They ought to meet the inspiring
young people who overcame so

00:02:52.428 --> 00:02:56.494
much, and worked so hard,
to earn their diplomas --

00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:59.461
in a school that believed in
their promise and gave them the

00:02:59.461 --> 00:03:01.828
opportunity to succeed.

00:03:01.828 --> 00:03:04.928
We need to give every child
in America that chance.

00:03:04.928 --> 00:03:08.227
That's why education
reform matters.

00:03:08.227 --> 00:03:10.528
Thanks for listening,
and have a great weekend.
