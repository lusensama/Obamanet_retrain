00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.145
The President:
Hi everybody.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:14.214
In America, we believe
that a lifetime of hard

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:16.883
work and responsibility
should be rewarded with a

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:20.286
shot at a secure,
dignified retirement.

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:22.722
It's one of the critical
components of middle-class

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:27.494
life - and this week, I
took new steps to protect it.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.596
Six years after the
crisis that shook a lot

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:32.165
of people's faith in
a secure retirement,

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.601
our economy is
steadily growing.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.603
Last year was the best
year for job growth

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:37.604
since the 1990s.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.100
All told, over the past
five years, the private

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:44.677
sector has added nearly
12 million new jobs.

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:47.113
And since I took office,
the stock market has more

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:50.750
than doubled,
replenishing the 401(k)s

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.186
of millions of families.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:55.655
But while we've come a
long way, we've got more

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.390
work to do to make sure
that our recovery reaches

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.593
more Americans, not
just those at the top.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:03.530
That's what middle-class
economics is all about-the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.399
idea that this country
does best when everyone

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.735
gets their fair shot,
everybody does their fair

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:12.872
share, and everyone plays
by the same set of rules.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:15.842
That last part-making sure
everyone plays by the same

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:18.144
set of rules-is why
we passed historic

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:21.948
Wall Street Reform and a
Credit Card Bill of Rights.

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:24.384
It's why we created a new
consumer watchdog agency.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:27.086
And it's why we're taking
new action to protect

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:30.557
hardworking families'
retirement security.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:33.660
If you're working hard and
putting away money, you

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.129
should have the peace of
mind that the financial

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.364
advice you're getting
is sound and that your

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:39.732
investments
are protected.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:44.103
But right now, there are
no rules of the road.

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:46.105
Many financial advisers
put their clients'

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:49.442
interest first - but some
financial advisers get

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:52.245
backdoor payments and
hidden fees in exchange

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:55.715
for steering people
into bad investments.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:58.284
All told, bad advice
that results from these

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:01.855
conflicts of interest
costs middle-class and

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:06.459
working families about
$17 billion every year.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.495
This week, I called on
the Department of Labor

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:11.731
to change that - to update
the rules and require that

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:14.200
retirement advisers
put the best interests

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.871
of their clients above their
own financial interests.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:20.106
Middle-class families
cannot afford to lose

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:24.043
their hard earned savings
after a lifetime of work.

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:27.647
They deserve to be treated
with fairness and respect.

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:30.483
And that's what
this rule would do.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.485
While many financial
advisers support these

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:34.821
basic safeguards to
prevent abuse, I know some

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.923
special interests will
fight this with everything

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.591
they've got.

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.293
But while we welcome
different perspectives

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:42.962
and ideas on how to move
forward, what I won't

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.298
accept is the notion that
there's nothing we can

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:47.500
do to make sure that
hard-working, responsible

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.803
Americans who scrimp and
save can retire with

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.406
security and dignity.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:55.542
We're going to keep
pushing for this rule,

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.544
because it's the right
thing to do for our

00:02:57.544 --> 00:03:00.213
workers and for
our country.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:02.215
The strength of our
economy rests on whether

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:04.484
hard-working families
can not only share in

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.753
America's success, but
can also contribute to

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:07.854
America's success.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.456
And that's what I will
never stop fighting for -

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:13.159
an economy where everyone
who works hard has the

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.194
chance to get ahead.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.196
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
