00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:10.361
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:13.194
Every year around this time,
American car companies start

00:00:13.194 --> 00:00:15.394
rolling out their
newest, shiniest models,

00:00:15.394 --> 00:00:17.695
hoping to entice
you into buying one.

00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:20.328
It's Detroit's chance to show
you what they've been working on

00:00:20.328 --> 00:00:21.761
-- the latest and greatest.

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:23.761
And this year is no exception.

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:26.361
They've got some pretty
good-looking cars coming out.

00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:28.194
But something is different
this time around --

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:31.594
and it starts with the
auto companies themselves.

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:34.895
Just a few years ago, the auto
industry wasn't just struggling

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:36.394
-- it was flatlining.

00:00:36.394 --> 00:00:38.961
GM and Chrysler were on
the verge of collapse.

00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:42.328
Suppliers and distributors
were at risk of going under.

00:00:42.328 --> 00:00:45.227
More than a million jobs across
the country were on the line --

00:00:45.227 --> 00:00:48.261
and not just auto jobs,
but the jobs of teachers,

00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:51.227
small business owners, and
everyone in communities that

00:00:51.227 --> 00:00:54.161
depend on this great
American industry.

00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:57.094
But we refused to throw in
the towel and do nothing.

00:00:57.094 --> 00:00:59.695
We refused to let
Detroit go bankrupt.

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:02.628
I bet on American workers
and American ingenuity,

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:06.628
and three years later, that
bet is paying off in a big way.

00:01:06.628 --> 00:01:08.695
Today, auto sales are the
highest they've been in more

00:01:08.695 --> 00:01:10.227
than four years.

00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:11.594
GM is back.

00:01:11.594 --> 00:01:13.761
Ford and Chrysler
are growing again.

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:16.261
Together, our auto industry has
created nearly a quarter of a

00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:18.928
million new jobs
right here in America.

00:01:18.928 --> 00:01:21.061
And we're not just making
more cars and trucks --

00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:22.861
we're making better ones.

00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:25.761
After 30 years of inaction, we
raised fuel standards so that by

00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:28.494
the middle of the next decade,
cars and light trucks will

00:01:28.494 --> 00:01:31.394
average almost 55
miles per gallon --

00:01:31.394 --> 00:01:33.828
nearly double what
they get today.

00:01:33.828 --> 00:01:36.494
That means you'll only have to
fill up every two weeks instead

00:01:36.494 --> 00:01:37.728
of every week.

00:01:37.728 --> 00:01:40.494
It's good for your wallet,
it's good for our economy,

00:01:40.494 --> 00:01:42.928
and it's good for
the environment.

00:01:42.928 --> 00:01:45.361
The technology that makes it
happen will also help America

00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:48.394
stay on the cutting edge
for decades to come.

00:01:48.394 --> 00:01:52.328
Just this week, GM announced
they plan to hire 1,500 workers

00:01:52.328 --> 00:01:55.061
for a new research center in
Michigan to help make sure the

00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:58.094
high-tech cars of tomorrow are
designed and built right here

00:01:58.094 --> 00:01:59.628
in America.

00:01:59.628 --> 00:02:02.328
I've also signed new bipartisan
trade agreements into law,

00:02:02.328 --> 00:02:04.895
because I want to see more cars
on the road in places like South

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:09.961
Korea imported from Detroit
and Toledo and Chicago.

00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:12.394
All of this is something the
American people can and should

00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:13.728
be proud of.

00:02:13.728 --> 00:02:16.728
It's a reminder that when the
American people put their mind

00:02:16.728 --> 00:02:19.861
to something, there's
nothing we can't do.

00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:23.928
So next time you see one of
those brand new 2013 models on

00:02:23.928 --> 00:02:28.895
TV or on the lot, think about
how far we've come together.

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:32.027
Think about how -- thanks to the
hard work and can-do spirit of

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:35.161
the American people -- more of
those cars and trucks are being

00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:38.861
manufactured by American
workers at American companies in

00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:41.227
communities all
across the country.

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:44.261
And they're going to save
you more money at the pump.

00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:45.961
That's what America's all about.

00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:48.428
When we get knocked
down, we get back up.

00:02:48.428 --> 00:02:49.861
We come back stronger.

00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:53.127
And as long as I'm President,
that's what we'll keep doing.

00:02:53.127 --> 00:02:54.695
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
