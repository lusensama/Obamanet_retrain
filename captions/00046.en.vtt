00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:11.511
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.647
This weekend is Memorial
Day-a time to pay tribute

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:17.884
to all our men and women in
uniform who've ever given

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:21.821
their lives so that we can
live in freedom and security.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.958
This year, the holiday is
especially meaningful.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.594
It's the first Memorial
Day since our war ended

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.996
in Afghanistan.

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:32.432
On Monday, at
Arlington Cemetery,

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:35.001
I'll join our Gold Star
families, veterans,

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.837
and their loved ones to
remember all our fallen

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:42.575
heroes, including the
more than 2,200 American

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.078
patriots who gave their
lives in Afghanistan.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.149
And I plan to share a
few of their stories.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.886
Growing up in Arizona, Wyatt
Martin loved the outdoors.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:56.623
To him, a great day was
a day spent fishing.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.992
After high school, he
enlisted in the Army because

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.594
he believed that the blessings
he enjoyed as an American

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:04.764
came with an obligation to
give back to his country.

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.235
Ramon Morris was
born in Jamaica,

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.805
and as a teenager
came to Queens.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:13.807
Like so many proud
immigrants, he felt

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:17.277
a calling to serve his new
country and joined the Army.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:20.313
He fell in love, got
engaged, and the thing

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:22.782
he wanted most was to make
the world safer for his

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:25.485
three-year-old daughter.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:28.054
In their lives,
Specialist Wyatt Martin

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:31.157
and Sergeant First Class
Ramon Morris travelled

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.592
different paths.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.627
But in December, their
paths intersected

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:36.629
as the final two
Americans to give their

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:40.066
lives during our combat
mission in Afghanistan.

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.735
This weekend also reminds
us that, around the world,

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.138
our men and women in
uniform continue to serve

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.273
and risk their lives.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.275
In Afghanistan, our
troops now have a new

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.979
mission-training and
advising Afghan forces.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.548
John Dawson was
one of them.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:59.452
From Massachusetts, he loved
the Bruins and the Pats.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:03.056
In April, he gave his life
as an Army combat medic-the

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:06.860
first American to give his
life in this new mission.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.362
This Memorial Day, we'll
honor Corporal Dawson

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:11.364
as well.

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:13.366
Like generations of
heroes before them,

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:16.336
these Americans gave
everything they had-not

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:19.539
for glory, not even
for gratitude, but for

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.876
something greater
than themselves.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.944
We cannot bring them back.

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:28.114
Nor can we ease the pain of
their families and friends

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:29.148
who live with their loss.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.386
But we are the Americans
they died to defend.

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:37.991
So what we can do-what we
must do-is fulfill our sacred

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:42.695
obligations to them, just like
they fulfilled theirs to us.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.731
We have to honor
their memory.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.733
We have to care
for their families,

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:49.135
and our veterans who
served with them.

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:51.604
And as a nation, we have
to remain worthy of their

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:55.642
sacrifice-forever committed
to the country they loved

00:02:55.642 --> 00:03:00.046
and the freedom they
fought for and died for.

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.549
Thank you, have a
wonderful weekend,

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.518
and may God bless our fallen
heroes and their families.
