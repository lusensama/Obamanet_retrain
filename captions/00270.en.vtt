00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:08.433
The President:
This week, the economists
who officially decide when

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:11.900
recessions start and end
declared the recession of 2008

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.367
to be over.

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:15.367
But if you're one of the
millions of Americans who lost

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:18.800
your home, your job, or your
savings as a consequence of the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.133
recession, this news is of
little comfort or value.

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:26.000
Yes, the economy is growing
instead of shrinking,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.600
as it was in 2008 and
the beginning of 2009.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.867
We're gaining private sector
jobs each month instead of

00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:36.100
losing 800,000, as we did
the month I took office.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.233
But we have to keep pushing
to promote growth that will

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:41.800
generate the jobs we need, and
repair the terrible damage the

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.500
recession has done.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.700
That's why I've proposed a
series of additional steps:

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.133
accelerated tax breaks for
businesses who buy equipment

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:52.533
now; a permanent research and
development tax break to promote

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.834
innovation by
American companies;

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:58.367
and a new initiative to rebuild
America's roads, rails,

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:02.400
and runways that will put folks
to work and make our country

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.300
more competitive.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.200
Taken together with the small
business tax cut and lending

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.467
plan we passed through
Congress last week,

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:12.233
these steps will help spur
jobs in the short run,

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:15.266
and strengthen our
economy for the long run.

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:18.567
Now, the Republicans who want to
take over Congress offered their

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:20.734
own ideas the other day.

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:23.900
Many were the very same policies
that led to the economic crisis

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.200
in the first place,
which isn't surprising,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.200
since many of their leaders were
among the architects of that

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.133
failed policy.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:34.800
It's grounded in same worn
out philosophy: cut taxes for

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.967
millionaires and billionaires;
cut the rules for Wall Street

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:41.200
and the special interests; and
cut the middle class loose to

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.133
fend for itself.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:45.900
That's not a prescription
for a better future.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.767
It's an echo of a disastrous
decade we can't afford to relive.

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:53.233
The Republicans in Washington
claimed to draw their ideas from

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:56.533
a website called
"America Speaking Out."

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.867
It turns out that one of the
ideas that's drawn the most

00:01:58.867 --> 00:02:02.834
interest on their website is
ending tax breaks for companies

00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:05.233
that ship jobs overseas.

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:07.934
The funny thing is, when we recently closed one of the most

00:02:07.934 --> 00:02:10.367
egregious loopholes for companies creating jobs

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:15.867
overseas, Republicans in Congress were almost unanimously opposed.

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:18.967
The Republican leader John
Boehner attacked us for it,

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:23.233
and stood up for outsourcing,
instead of American workers.

00:02:23.233 --> 00:02:26.700
So, America may be speaking out,
but Republicans in Congress sure

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.133
aren't listening.

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:30.000
They want to put special
interests back in the driver's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.667
seat in Washington.

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:33.800
They want to roll back the law
that will finally stop health

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.467
insurance companies from denying
you coverage on the basis of a

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:38.166
preexisting condition.

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:40.900
They want to repeal reforms that
will finally protect hardworking

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.066
families from hidden rates and
penalties every time they use a

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.166
credit card, make
a mortgage payment,

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.100
or take out a student loan.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.367
And for all their talk about
reining in spending and getting

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:54.333
our deficits under control, they
want to borrow another $700

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:59.400
billion, and use it to give
tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.133
On average, that's a tax cut of
about $100,000 for millionaires.

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:07.567
Instead of cutting taxes
for the wealthiest few --

00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:11.000
tax breaks we cannot afford -- I've called for tax cuts for

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.533
middle class families who saw their incomes shrink by 5%

00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:17.400
during the last, lost decade.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.233
We've already cut eight different taxes for small

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:22.000
business owners to help them hire and grow,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.367
and we're going to cut eight more.

00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:26.867
We're challenging our states
and schools to do a better job

00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:29.700
educating our kids and making
college more affordable so

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.834
America can once more lead the
world in the proportion of our

00:03:32.834 --> 00:03:35.734
children graduating from college.

00:03:35.734 --> 00:03:38.900
And we're putting an end to the
days of taxpayer-funded bailouts

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.667
so Main Street never again
has to pay for Wall Street's mistakes.

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:45.467
America is a great country.

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:48.667
Our democracy is vibrant,
our economy is dynamic,

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:51.533
and our workers can
outcompete the best of them.

00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:54.400
But the way for us to remain the
greatest country on Earth isn't

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.333
to turn back the clock and put
the special interests back in charge.

00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:01.834
It's to make sure all our people
are getting a fair shake.

00:04:01.834 --> 00:04:04.300
It's to make sure everyone who's
willing to work for it still has

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.133
a chance to reach for
the American dream.

00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:10.633
And that will remain my mission
every single day so long as I

00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:13.400
have the honor of
serving as President.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.867
Have a nice weekend, everybody.
