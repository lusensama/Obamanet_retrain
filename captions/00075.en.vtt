00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.478
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.413
For the first time
in more than 6 years,

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:16.616
the unemployment
rate is below 6%.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:18.618
Over the past four
and a half years,

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:21.588
our businesses have created
more than 10 million new jobs.

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:23.623
That's the longest
uninterrupted stretch

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:27.394
of private sector job
creation in our history.

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.496
But while our businesses are
creating jobs at the fastest

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:31.798
pace since the '90s,
the typical family

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:35.135
hasn't seen a raise
since the '90s also.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.737
Folks are feeling
as squeezed as ever.

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:40.039
That's why I'm going to keep
pushing policies that will

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.644
create more jobs faster
and raise wages faster -

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.046
policies like rebuilding
our infrastructure,

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.048
making sure women
are paid fairly,

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:51.484
and making it easier for
young people to pay off

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.620
their student loans.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.922
But one of the simplest and
fastest ways to start helping

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:59.793
folks get ahead is by
raising the minimum wage.

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:05.565
Ask yourself: could you
live on $14,500 a year?

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.567
That's what someone
working full-time

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.569
on the minimum wage makes.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.839
If they're raising kids,
that's below the poverty line.

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.340
And that's not right.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.411
A hard day's work
deserves a fair day's pay.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.247
Right now, a worker on the
federal minimum wage earns

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.850
$7.25 an hour.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.854
It's time to raise
that to $10.10 an hour.

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:29.856
Raising the federal minimum
wage to ten dollars

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.525
and ten cents an hour, or
ten-ten, would benefit

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.394
28 million
American workers.

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:35.962
28 million.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:38.698
And these aren't just high
schoolers on their first job.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:42.335
The average worker who would
benefit is 35 years old.

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:44.337
Most low-wage
workers are women.

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:46.439
And that extra money would
help them pay the bills

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.374
and provide for
their families.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.543
It also means they'll have
more money to spend at local

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:54.848
businesses - which grows
the economy for everyone.

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:57.550
But Congress hasn't voted
to raise the minimum wage

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.985
in seven years.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:01:59.986
Seven years.

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:02.589
And when it got a vote
earlier this year,

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:05.158
Republicans flat-out voted "no."

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:08.061
That's why, since the first time
I asked Congress to give

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:11.097
America a raise, 13
states, 21 cities

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:14.234
and the District of
Columbia have gone around

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:17.070
Congress to raise
their workers' wages.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.072
Five more states have
minimum wage initiatives

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.874
on the ballot next month.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:23.810
More companies are choosing to
raise their workers' wages.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.145
A recent survey shows that a
majority of small business

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:28.848
owners support a gradual
increase to ten-ten

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:29.849
an hour, too.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.218
And I've done what I can on
my own by requiring

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:35.255
federal contractors to pay
their workers at least

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.357
ten-ten an hour.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:39.993
On Friday, a coalition
of citizens - including

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:43.296
business leaders, working
moms, labor unions,

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:47.901
and more than 65 mayors - told
Republicans in Congress to stop

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:51.804
blocking a raise for millions
of hard-working Americans.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.773
Because we believe
that in America,

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:56.009
nobody who works full-time
should ever have to raise

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.777
a family in poverty.

00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:00.313
And I'm going to keep up
this fight until we win.

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:02.749
Because America deserves
a raise right now.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:06.219
And America should forever
be a place where your

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:08.655
hard work is rewarded.

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:09.355
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
