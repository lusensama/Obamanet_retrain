00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.567
The President:
Today, America faces a
make-or-break moment for the

00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:10.133
middle class.

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.834
After the worst economic
crisis of our lifetimes,

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:16.000
some still want to return to
the same policies that got us

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.667
into this mess.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:19.967
They're the same policies that
have stacked the deck against

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:23.133
working Americans
for way too long.

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.433
They're part of a philosophy
that says we're better off when

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:28.600
everyone is left to fend
for themselves and play by

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.433
their own rules.

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:32.333
But I have a different vision.

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:36.367
I believe that we are greater
together than we are on our own.

00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:39.100
I believe that this country
succeeds when everyone gets a

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.100
fair shot, everyone
does their fair share,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.567
and everyone engages
in fair play.

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:49.700
To ensure fair play, last year,
we passed the toughest financial

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.133
reform in generations.

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:55.100
See, for too long, the rules
weren't the same on Wall Street

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.200
as they were on Main Street.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.633
Risky bets were made with
other people's money.

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:04.000
Some folks made a lot of money
taking advantage of consumers.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.834
It was wrong.

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:09.300
And this irresponsible behavior
on the part of some contributed

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.700
to the worst financial crisis
since the Great Depression.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.767
So this financial reform
refocuses the financial sector

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:19.300
on what's really important:
getting capital to entrepreneurs

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.133
who want to grow
their businesses,

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:24.266
and financing to millions of
families who want to buy a house

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.400
or send their kids to college.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.433
A key part of that was putting
in place the first-ever consumer

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:33.567
watchdog -- someone whose job it
is to protect American families

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:36.500
from being taken advantage
of by mortgage lenders,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.433
payday lenders, and
debt collectors.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:42.900
Tens of millions of Americans
use these services.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.667
Protecting them from
unscrupulous practices is an

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:47.066
important job.

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:49.633
And that's why I nominated
Richard Cordray to serve as the

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:52.900
head of this consumer
watchdog agency.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.934
As the former Attorney
General of Ohio,

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:58.767
Richard helped recover billions
of dollars on behalf of retirees

00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:01.900
and stood up to dishonest
lending practices.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.300
He has the support of most
Attorney Generals across the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.934
country, both Democrats
and Republicans.

00:02:07.934 --> 00:02:10.567
Members of Congress from both
parties say he's more than

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:12.700
qualified for the job.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.834
And yet on Thursday, Republicans
blocked his nomination.

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:20.033
They refused to even allow
it to come up for a vote.

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:22.033
That doesn't make any sense.

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:24.533
Do Republicans in Congress think
our financial crisis was caused

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:27.000
by too much oversight
of mortgage lenders or

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.567
debt collectors?

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:30.000
Of course not.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.700
And every day America has
to wait for a new consumer

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.200
protection watchdog is another
day that dishonest businesses

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.467
can target and take advantage
of students, seniors,

00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:41.400
and service members.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.300
So I refuse to take
"no" for an answer.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.367
Financial institutions have
plenty of high-powered lawyers

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.767
and lobbyists
looking out for them.

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:53.000
It's time consumers had
someone on their side.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.500
And while they're at it,
Republicans in Congress should

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.300
stop the games and extend
the payroll tax cut for

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.066
working Americans.

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:03.600
Because if they don't, nearly
160 million Americans will see

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.300
their taxes go up at
the end of this month.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.734
Congress cannot end the year by
taking money out of the pockets

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:12.600
of working Americans.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.800
Now is not the time
for playing politics.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.000
Now is the time to do what's
right for the American people.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.867
No one should go home for the
holidays until we get this done.

00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:26.166
So tell your Members of
Congress, don't be a Grinch.

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:29.900
Tell them to do the right thing
for you and for our economy.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.033
Thanks.
