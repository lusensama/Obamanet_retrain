00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:09.467
President Obama:
This weekend, I'm concluding a
trip to Asia whose purpose was

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:12.600
to open new markets for American
products in this fast-growing

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.133
part of the world.

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.734
The economic battle for
these markets is fierce,

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:18.734
and we're up against
strong competitors.

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:21.200
But as I've said many
times, America doesn't

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.300
play for second place.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.467
The future we're fighting
for isn't as the world's

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:28.767
largest importer, consuming
products made elsewhere,

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:31.600
but as the world's largest
manufacturer of ideas and

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.000
goods sold around the world.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.333
Opening new markets will not
only help America's businesses

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.834
create new jobs for
American workers.

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:42.000
It will also help us reduce our
deficits - because the single

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.734
greatest tool for getting
our fiscal house in order

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:46.867
is robust economic growth.

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:49.734
That kind of growth will require
ensuring that our students are

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:51.734
getting the best
education possible;

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:54.467
that we're on the cutting edge
of research and development;

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:57.233
and that we're rebuilding
our roads and railways,

00:00:57.233 --> 00:00:59.800
runways and ports - so our
infrastructure is up to the

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.800
challenges of the 21st century.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.467
Given the deficits that have
mounted up over the past decade,

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:08.033
we can't afford to make
these investments unless

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:10.400
we're also willing to
cut what we don't need.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.133
That's why I've submitted to
Congress a plan for a three-year

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:17.400
budget freeze, and I'm prepared
to offer additional savings.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.667
But as we work to
reform our budget,

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:22.333
Congress should also put
some skin in the game.

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.800
I agree with those Republican
and Democratic members of

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.467
Congress who've recently said
that in these challenging days,

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:31.400
we can't afford what
are called earmarks.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.200
These are items inserted into
spending bills by members of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.233
Congress without
adequate review.

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:39.533
Now, some of these earmarks
support worthy projects in

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.033
our local communities.

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.734
But many others do not.

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:44.967
We can't afford Bridges to
Nowhere like the one that

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:48.100
was planned a few
years back in Alaska.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.533
Earmarks like these represent a
relatively small part of overall

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:52.900
federal spending.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.000
But when it comes to signaling
our commitment to fiscal

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.066
responsibility, addressing them
would have an important impact.

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:03.400
As a Senator, I helped eliminate
anonymous earmarks and created

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.066
new measures of transparency so
Americans can better follow how

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:09.367
their tax dollars
are being spent.

00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:12.567
As President, time and again,
I've called for new limitations

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:13.734
on earmarks.

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:17.000
We've reduced the cost of
earmarks by over $3 billion.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.133
And we've put in place higher
standards of transparency by

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:24.700
putting as much information
as possible on earmarks.gov.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.500
In fact, this week, we updated
the site with more information

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.400
about where last year's
earmarks were actually spent,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.133
and made it easier to look up
Members of Congress and the

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:35.533
earmarks they fought for.

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:38.000
Today, we have a
chance to go further.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.600
We have a chance to not
only shine a light on a bad

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.000
Washington habit that wastes
billions of taxpayer dollars,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but take a step towards
restoring public trust.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.400
We have a chance to advance the
interests not of Republicans or

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.934
Democrats, but of
the American people;

00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:55.600
to put our country on the
path of fiscal discipline

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.633
and responsibility that will
lead to a brighter economic

00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:00.100
future for all.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.734
And that's a future I hope we
can reach across party lines

00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:04.166
to build together.

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:06.367
Thanks everybody, and
have a great weekend.
