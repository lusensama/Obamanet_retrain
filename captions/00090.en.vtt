00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.800
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.200
As President, my top
priority is rebuilding

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.467
an economy where everybody
who works hard

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:17.567
has the chance to get ahead.

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:20.200
That's what I'll spend
some time talking about

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.433
on Monday, at the White
House Summit

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.500
on Working Families.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.400
We're bringing together
business leaders

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.166
and workers to talk about the
challenges that working

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.734
parents face every day,

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:34.333
and how we can address them together.

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.500
Take paid family leave.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.066
Many jobs don't offer
adequate leave to care

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.633
for a new baby or an ailing
parent, so workers can't

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:44.133
afford to be there when
their family

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.033
needs them the most.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:47.033
That's wrong.

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:50.300
And it puts us way
behind the times.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.400
Only three countries in
the world report

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.400
that they don't offer paid
maternity leave.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.467
Three.

00:00:57.467 --> 00:00:59.900
And the United States
is one of them.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.000
It's time to change that.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.166
A few states have acted on
their own to give workers

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.734
paid family leave, but
this should be available

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:08.967
to everyone, because all
Americans should

00:01:08.967 --> 00:01:13.433
be able to afford to care for a
family member in need.

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:15.433
Childcare is
another challenge.

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:17.367
Most working families
I know can't afford

00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:20.133
thousands a year for
childcare, but often

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.000
that's what it costs.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.500
That leaves parents
scrambling just

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.467
to make sure their kids are safe
while they're at work --

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:28.200
forget about giving them
the high-quality

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.600
early childhood education that
helps kids

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.100
succeed in life.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.066
Then there's the issue of
flexibility --

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.967
the ability to take a few hours
off for a parent-teacher

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:40.700
conference or to work from
home when

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.600
your kid is sick.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.033
Most workers want it, but
not enough

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:46.533
of them have it.

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.767
What's more, it not only
makes workers happier --

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:51.700
studies show that
flexibility can make

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.066
workers more productive
and reduce worker turnover

00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:56.700
and absenteeism.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.433
That's good for business.

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:01.200
At a time when women make
up about half of America's

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.967
workforce, outdated
workplace policies

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:06.533
that make it harder for mothers
to work hold

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.667
our entire economy back.

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:11.166
But these aren't just
problems for women.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:14.367
Men also care about who's
watching their kids.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.133
They're rearranging their
schedules to make

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:18.667
it to soccer games and
school plays.

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:21.266
Lots of sons help care
for aging parents.

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.633
And plenty of fathers
would love to be home

00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:26.867
for their new baby's first
weeks in the world.

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:29.867
In fact, in a new study,
nearly half of all parents

00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:33.066
- women and men - report
that they've said

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:35.567
no to a job, not because they
didn't want it, 

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:38.800
but because it would be too
hard on their families.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.166
When that many talented,
hard-working people

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:42.367
are forced to choose between

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:45.233
work and family, something's wrong.

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:47.300
Other countries are making
it easier for people

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.800
to have both.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.333
We should too, if we want
American businesses

00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:55.233
to compete and win in
the global economy.

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:56.700
Family leave.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.967
Childcare.

00:02:57.967 --> 00:02:59.600
Flexibility.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.967
These aren't frills --
they're basic needs.

00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:04.533
They shouldn't be bonuses
-- they should

00:03:04.533 --> 00:03:06.867
be the bottom line.

00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:09.233
The good news is, some
businesses are embracing

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:11.400
family-friendly policies,
because they know

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.033
it's key to attracting and
retaining

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:14.133
talented employees.

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:15.934
And I'm going to keep
highlighting

00:03:15.934 --> 00:03:17.700
the businesses that do.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.700
Because I take
this personally.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.633
I take it personally as
the son and grandson

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:24.834
of some strong women who
worked hard to support

00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:26.400
my sister and me.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.367
As the husband of a
brilliant woman

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:32.133
who struggled to balance work
and raising our girls

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:35.000
 when my job
often kept me away.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.967
And as the father of two
beautiful girls,

00:03:38.967 --> 00:03:41.834
whom I want to be there for as
much as I possibly can

00:03:41.834 --> 00:03:44.200
-- and whom I hope will be
able to have families

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:46.967
and careers of their
own one day.

00:03:46.967 --> 00:03:49.367
We know from our history
that our economy grows

00:03:49.367 --> 00:03:51.934
best from the middle-out;
that our country does

00:03:51.934 --> 00:03:53.133
better when everybody

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:55.667
participates; when everyone's talents are put

00:03:55.667 --> 00:03:59.000
to use; when we all have a fair shot.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.967
That's the America
I believe in.

00:04:00.967 --> 00:04:02.700
That's the America I'll
keep fighting

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.533
for every day.

00:04:04.533 --> 00:04:06.033
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
