00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:08.633
The President:
Leaders of the world's largest economies will gather next week

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:11.467
in Pittsburgh for the
second time this year.

00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:14.200
The first meeting of the G20
nations in April came at the

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.767
height of the global
financial crisis --

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:19.367
a crisis that required
unprecedented international

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:23.467
cooperation to jumpstart the
world's economies and help break

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:27.033
the downward spiral that
enveloped all our nations.

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.300
At next week's summit,
we'll have, in effect,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.166
a five-month checkup to review
the steps each nation has taken

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.033
-- separately and together
-- to break the back of this

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:37.667
economic crisis.

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:40.300
And the good news is that we've
made real progress since the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.333
last time we met -- here at
home and around the world.

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.967
In February, we
enacted a Recovery Act,

00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:50.133
providing relief to Americans
who need it, preventing layoffs,

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.633
and putting Americans
back to work.

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:55.333
We've worked to unlock
frozen credit markets,

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.800
spurring lending to Americans
looking to buy homes or cars,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.100
take out student loans, or
finance small businesses.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.934
And we've challenged other
nations to join us not only to

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:08.133
spur global demand, but to
address the underlying problems

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:12.066
that caused such a deep global
recession in the first place.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:15.033
Because of the steps taken by
our nations and all nations,

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:18.200
we can now say that we've
stopped our economic freefall.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.033
But we also know that
stopping the bleeding isn't

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:21.567
nearly enough.

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:23.500
Our work is far from over.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.633
We know we still have a lot to
do here at home to build an

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:29.400
economy that is producing good
jobs for all those who are

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.367
looking for work today.

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:33.367
And we know we still
have a lot to do,

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:35.533
in conjunction with the
nations around the world,

00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.600
to strengthen the rules
governing financial markets and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.433
ensure that we never again find
ourselves in the precarious

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:45.133
situation we found ourselves
in just one year ago.

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.533
As I told leaders of our
financial community in New York

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:51.667
City earlier this week, a
return to normalcy can't

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:53.567
breed complacency.

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:55.734
To protect our economy and people from another market

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:58.800
meltdown, our government needs to fundamentally reform the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.400
rules governing financial
firms and markets to meet the

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.767
challenges of the 21st century.

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:07.734
We can't allow the thirst for
reckless schemes that produce

00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:11.867
quick profits and fat executive
bonuses to override the security

00:02:11.867 --> 00:02:15.700
of our entire financial system
and leave taxpayers on the hook

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.734
for cleaning up the mess.

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:20.667
And as the world's largest
economy, we must lead,

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:22.867
not just by word,
but by example,

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:25.000
understanding that
in the 21st century,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.567
financial crises
know no borders.

00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:30.734
All of us need to act more
responsibly on behalf of a

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:32.533
better economic future.

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:34.867
That's why, at next
week's G20 summit,

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:37.567
we'll discuss some of the steps
that are required to safeguard

00:02:37.567 --> 00:02:40.767
our global financial system and
close gaps in regulation around

00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:43.900
the world -- gaps that
permitted the kinds of reckless

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.133
risk-taking and irresponsibility that led to the crisis.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:50.000
And that's why I've called on
Congress to put in place a

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.266
series of tough, common-sense
rules of the road that will

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:56.667
protect consumers from abuse,
let markets function fairly and

00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:00.133
freely, and help prevent a
crisis like this from ever

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:02.033
happening again.

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:05.033
Central to these reforms
is a new Consumer Financial

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:06.700
Protection Agency.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.567
Part of what led to this crisis
were not just decisions made on

00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:12.533
Wall Street, but also
unsustainable mortgage loans

00:03:12.533 --> 00:03:14.133
made across the country.

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:16.266
While many folks took on more
than they knew they could

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:19.233
afford, too often folks signed
contracts they didn't fully

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:21.567
understand offered by
lenders who didn't always

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:22.767
tell the truth.

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:25.700
That's why we need clear
rules, clearly enforced.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.133
And that's what
this agency will do.

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:30.500
Consumers shouldn't have to
worry about loan contracts

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.333
written to confuse, hidden fees
attached to their mortgages,

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:36.667
and financial penalties -- whether through a credit card or

00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:39.166
debit card -- that appear without a clear warning on

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:40.367
their statements.

00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:43.266
And responsible lenders,
including community banks,

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:45.834
trying to do the right thing
shouldn't have to worry about

00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:50.667
ruinous competition from
unregulated and unscrupulous competitors.

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:54.100
Not surprisingly, lobbyists for
big Wall Street banks are hard

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.233
at work trying to stop reforms
that would hold them accountable

00:03:57.233 --> 00:03:59.667
and they want to keep
things just the way they are.

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:03.700
But we can't let politics as
usual triumph so business as

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.200
usual can reign.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.300
We can't let the narrow interests of a few come before

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.133
the interests of all of us.

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:11.900
We can't forget how close
we came to the brink,

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.800
and perpetuate the broken system
and breakdown of responsibility

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.400
that made it possible.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.033
In the weeks and months ahead,
we have an opportunity to build

00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:21.767
on the work we've already done.

00:04:21.767 --> 00:04:24.500
An opportunity to rebuild
our global economy stronger

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.700
than before.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.367
An opportunity not only to
protect the American people and

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:31.633
America's economy, but to
promote sustained and balanced

00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:35.767
growth and prosperity for
our nation and all nations.

00:04:35.767 --> 00:04:38.800
And that's an opportunity
I am determined to seize.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.500
So, thanks for listening
and thanks for watching,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.200
and to our Jewish friends, who
are celebrating Rosh Hashanah,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.734
have a happy and
healthy New Year.

00:04:47.734 --> 00:04:48.834
Shanah Tovah.
