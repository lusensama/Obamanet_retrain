00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.934
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:14.500
Today, our economy is
growing and our businesses

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.500
are consistently
generating new jobs.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.834
But decades-long trends
still threaten

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:21.600
the middle class.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.033
While those at the top are
doing better than ever,

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:26.700
too many Americans are
working harder than ever,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.100
but feel like they
can't get ahead.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:31.266
That's why the budget I
sent Congress earlier this

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:35.300
year is built on the idea
of opportunity for all.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.533
It will grow the middle
class and shrink the

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.333
deficits we've already
cut in half since

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.333
I took office.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.600
It's an opportunity
agenda with four goals.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.500
Number one is creating
more good jobs

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.066
that pay good wages.

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.000
Number two is training
more Americans with

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.300
the skills to fill those jobs.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.333
Number three is
guaranteeing every

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.233
child access to a
great education.

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:59.166
And number four is making
work pay - with wages

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.000
you can live on, savings you
can retire on,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.533
and health care that's there for
you when you need it.

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.967
This week, the Republicans
in Congress put forward

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:08.967
a very different budget.

00:01:08.967 --> 00:01:12.100
And it does just the
opposite: it shrinks

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.500
opportunity and makes it
harder for Americans

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.166
who work hard to get ahead.

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.233
The Republican budget
begins by handing out

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:22.000
massive tax cuts to
households making more

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.500
than $1 million a year.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.333
Then, to keep from blowing
a hole in the deficit,

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.367
they'd have to raise taxes
on middle-class

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:31.633
families with kids.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.567
Next, their budget forces
deep cuts to investments

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:36.600
that help our economy
create jobs,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.900
like education and
scientific research.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.934
Now, they won't tell you
where

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.066
these cuts will fall.

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:45.600
But compared to my budget,
if they cut everything

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.734
evenly, then within a few
years, about

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:52.900
170,000 kids will be cut from
early education programs.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.400
About 200,000 new mothers
and kids will

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.934
be cut off from programs to help
them get healthy food.

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:01.166
Schools across the country
will lose funding that

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:04.533
supports 21,000 special
education teachers.

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:07.133
And if they want to make
smaller cuts to one

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:10.233
of these areas, that means
larger cuts in others.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.667
Unsurprisingly, the
Republican budget

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:15.333
also tries to repeal the
Affordable Care Act -

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:17.500
even though that would take
away health coverage

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.266
from the more than seven
million Americans

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:21.333
who've done the responsible
thing and signed

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.400
up to buy health insurance.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.133
And for good measure,
their budget guts

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:28.500
the rules we put in place to
protect the middle

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.967
class from another financial
crisis like the

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:33.100
one we've had to fight so hard
to recover from.

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:37.100
Policies that benefit a
fortunate few while making

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.800
it harder for working
Americans to succeed

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.000
are not what we
need right now.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.700
Our economy doesn't grow
best from the top-down;

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.967
it grows best from
the middle-out.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.400
That's what my opportunity
agenda does -

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.934
and it's what I'll keep
fighting for.

00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:52.934
Thanks.

00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:53.934
And have a great weekend.
