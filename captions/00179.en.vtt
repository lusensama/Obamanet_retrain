00:00:08.828 --> 00:00:10.127
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.127 --> 00:00:12.828
This week, I spent some time
traveling across Iowa talking

00:00:12.828 --> 00:00:16.494
with folks about rebuilding an
economy where if you work hard,

00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:18.494
you and your family
can get ahead.

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:21.961
And along the way, I stopped in
at Cascade High School to thank

00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:24.728
the teachers there for
doing such a great job --

00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:27.161
and wish them luck as they
head back to the classroom for

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:28.861
this school year.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:31.628
There's nothing more important
to our country's future than the

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:33.594
education we give our kids.

00:00:33.594 --> 00:00:36.294
And there's no one more
important to that education than

00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:39.094
the person at the
front of the classroom.

00:00:39.094 --> 00:00:40.728
Teachers matter.

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:43.294
Most work tirelessly,
with modest pay,

00:00:43.294 --> 00:00:46.294
sometimes digging into their own
pocket for school supplies --

00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:48.261
just to make a difference.

00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:50.027
They give everything
for our kids --

00:00:50.027 --> 00:00:53.227
and in return, we
should invest in them.

00:00:53.227 --> 00:00:56.961
But here's the thing: this year,
several thousand fewer educators

00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:58.994
will be going back to school.

00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:03.928
Since 2009, we've lost more than
300,000 education jobs, in part,

00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:07.061
because of budget cuts at
the state and local level.

00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:09.528
Think about what that
means for our country.

00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:11.895
At a time when the rest of the
world is racing to out-educate

00:01:11.895 --> 00:01:16.227
America, these cuts force our
kids into crowded classrooms,

00:01:16.227 --> 00:01:19.628
cancel programs for preschoolers
and kindergartners,

00:01:19.628 --> 00:01:23.194
and shorten the school
week and the school year.

00:01:23.194 --> 00:01:26.194
That's the opposite of what we
should be doing as a country.

00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:28.227
States should be making
education a priority in their

00:01:28.227 --> 00:01:30.828
budgets, even in
tough fiscal times.

00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:33.094
And Congress should be
willing to help out --

00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:35.361
because this affects all of us.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.728
That's why part of the jobs bill
that I sent to Congress last

00:01:37.728 --> 00:01:41.061
September included support
for states to prevent further

00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:44.861
layoffs and to rehire teachers
who'd lost their jobs.

00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:47.728
But here we are -- a year later
with tens of thousands more

00:01:47.728 --> 00:01:50.661
educators laid off -- and
Congress still hasn't done

00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:52.461
anything about it.

00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:54.961
In fact, the economic plan
that almost every Republican in

00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:58.127
Congress voted for would make
the situation even worse.

00:01:58.127 --> 00:02:00.494
It would actually cut
funding for education --

00:02:00.494 --> 00:02:02.594
which means fewer
kids in Head Start,

00:02:02.594 --> 00:02:04.528
fewer teachers in
our classrooms,

00:02:04.528 --> 00:02:07.628
and fewer college students
with access to financial aid --

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:10.227
all to pay for a massive
new tax cut for millionaires

00:02:10.227 --> 00:02:11.895
and billionaires.

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:13.227
That's backwards.

00:02:13.227 --> 00:02:14.494
That's wrong.

00:02:14.494 --> 00:02:18.027
That plan doesn't invest in our
future; it undercuts our future.

00:02:18.027 --> 00:02:20.094
If we want America to
lead in the 21st century,

00:02:20.094 --> 00:02:22.428
nothing is more important
than giving everyone the best

00:02:22.428 --> 00:02:25.428
education possible -- from the
day they start preschool to the

00:02:25.428 --> 00:02:27.294
day they start their career.

00:02:27.294 --> 00:02:29.594
That's why we launched a
national competition to

00:02:29.594 --> 00:02:31.061
improve our schools.

00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:34.628
And for less than 1% of what our
nation spends on education each

00:02:34.628 --> 00:02:37.561
year, we've encouraged almost
every state to raise their

00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:41.828
standards -- the first time
that's happened in a generation.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.428
That's why we've invested in
math and science education,

00:02:44.428 --> 00:02:46.861
and given states more
flexibility on No Child

00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:48.394
Left Behind.

00:02:48.394 --> 00:02:51.227
And that's why we've reformed
the student loan program to put

00:02:51.227 --> 00:02:54.761
students before big banks, and
increased financial aid for

00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:57.628
millions of young people --
because in America, higher

00:02:57.628 --> 00:03:01.728
education can't be a luxury;
it's an economic necessity every

00:03:01.728 --> 00:03:04.294
family should be able to afford.

00:03:04.294 --> 00:03:06.461
This is a country where no
matter what you look like or

00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:09.828
where you come from, if you're
willing to study and work hard,

00:03:09.828 --> 00:03:12.828
you can go as far as your
talents will take you.

00:03:12.828 --> 00:03:15.194
You can make it if you try.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.795
I am only the President of the
United States today because of

00:03:17.795 --> 00:03:20.494
the chance my education gave me.

00:03:20.494 --> 00:03:22.161
And I want every child
in America to have

00:03:22.161 --> 00:03:24.161
that same chance.

00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:25.594
That's what I'm fighting for.

00:03:25.594 --> 00:03:27.461
And as long as I have the
privilege of being your

00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:30.728
President, that's what I'm
going to keep fighting for.

00:03:30.728 --> 00:03:32.528
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
