00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.767
The President:
Last week, when I ordered our
armed forces to protect the

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:12.200
Libyan people from the
brutality of Moammar Qaddafi,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.300
I pledged to keep the American
people fully informed.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.333
Since then, I've spoken about
the limited scope and specific

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.500
purpose of this mission.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.734
Today, I can report that thanks
to the brave men and women in

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:27.066
uniform, we've made
important progress.

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:30.767
As Commander-in-Chief, I face no
greater decision than sending

00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:33.967
our military men and
women into harm's way.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.734
And the United States
should not -- and cannot --

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:40.633
intervene every time there's a
crisis somewhere in the world.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:43.467
But I firmly believe that when
innocent people are being

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:47.100
brutalized; when someone like
Qaddafi threatens a bloodbath

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.567
that could destabilize
an entire region;

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:52.367
and when the international
community is prepared to come

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:55.700
together to save many
thousands of lives --

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.934
then it's in our national
interest to act.

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:01.867
And it's our responsibility.

00:01:01.867 --> 00:01:03.567
This is one of those times.

00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:07.166
Our military mission in
Libya is clear and focused.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.400
Along with our
allies and partners,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.934
we're enforcing the mandate of
the United Nations Security Council.

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:16.600
We're protecting the Libyan
people from Qaddafi's forces.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.700
And we've put in place a no
fly zone and other measures to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.934
prevent further atrocities.

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:24.233
We're succeeding in our mission.

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:26.667
We've taken out
Libya's air defenses.

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:30.667
Qaddafi's forces are no longer
advancing across Libya.

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:34.600
In places like Benghazi, a city
of some 700,000 that Qaddafi

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.400
threatened to show "no mercy,"
his forces have been pushed back.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.700
So make no mistake,
because we acted quickly,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.233
a humanitarian catastrophe has
been avoided and the lives of

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:50.600
countless civilians -- innocent
men, women and children --

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.500
have been saved.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.266
As I pledged at the outset, the role
of American forces has been limited.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:00.567
We're not putting any
ground forces into Libya.

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:04.133
Our military has provided unique
capabilities at the beginning,

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:07.166
but this is now a broad,
international effort.

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:10.033
Our allies and partners are
enforcing the no fly zone over

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:13.467
Libya and the arms
embargo at sea.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.934
Key Arab partners like Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates have

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:18.667
committed aircraft.

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:21.433
And as agreed this week,
responsibility for this

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:25.166
operation is being transferred
from the United States to our

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:27.734
NATO allies and partners.

00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:30.700
This is how the international
community should work --

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.400
more nations, not just
the United States,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.633
bearing the responsibility and
cost of upholding peace and security.

00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:41.767
This military effort is part of
our larger strategy to support

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:45.834
the Libyan people and hold the
Qaddafi regime accountable.

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:47.633
Together with the
international community,

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:50.300
we're delivering urgent
humanitarian assistance.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.166
We're offering support
to the Libyan opposition.

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:57.300
We've frozen tens of billions of
dollars of Qaddafi's assets that

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.700
can help meet the needs and
aspirations of the Libyan people.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.900
And every day, the pressure on
Qaddafi and his regime is increasing.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.400
Our message is clear
and unwavering.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.467
Qaddafi's attacks against
civilians must stop.

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:14.567
His forces must pull back.

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:18.567
Humanitarian assistance must be
allowed to reach those in need.

00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:22.266
Those responsible for violence
must be held accountable.

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:25.433
Moammar Qaddafi has lost the
confidence of his people and the

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:29.467
legitimacy to rule, and the
aspirations of the Libyan people

00:03:29.467 --> 00:03:31.133
must be realized.

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:34.400
In recent days, we've heard the
voices of Libyans expressing

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.900
their gratitude
for this mission.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.967
"You saved our lives,"
said one Libyan.

00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:43.567
Said another, "Today,
there is hope."

00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:47.533
Every American can be proud of
the lives we've saved in Libya

00:03:47.533 --> 00:03:50.500
and of the service of our men
and women in uniform who once

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.734
again have stood up for our
interests and our ideals.

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:57.734
And people in Libya and around
the world are seeing that the

00:03:57.734 --> 00:04:01.600
United States of America stands
with those who hope for a future

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.934
where they can determine
their own destiny.
