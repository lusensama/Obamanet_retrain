00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:11.144
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:15.048
Seven years after the worst
economic crisis in generations,

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:18.485
our economy continues to
grow and create jobs.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.755
In fact, our businesses have
created 13 million new jobs

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:23.757
over the past five
and a half years.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.993
But if we want to keep this
momentum going - to make sure

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:29.696
that working families feel
like their hard work is being

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:33.266
rewarded with a basic sense
of security - then we all

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.301
need to do our part.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.303
That's why my Administration
has been partnering with

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:40.807
states and cities to help
grow the middle class.

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.009
Over the past few years,
nearly 20 cities and

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:45.745
counties have implemented
paid sick days.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:49.849
Six states have enacted paid
sick days or paid family leave.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:53.386
Seventeen states, and more than
two dozen cities and counties,

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.655
have raised their
minimum wage.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.657
All of this will help
working families.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:01.227
And across the country, folks
are proving that preparing all

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:04.564
our kids for the future doesn't
have to be a partisan issue.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:07.767
Seattle, a city with a
Democratic mayor, just passed

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.837
universal pre-k, while
Indianapolis, a city with

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:15.275
a Republican mayor, is starting
citywide preschool scholarships.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:18.845
All told, 34 states have
increased funding for preschool.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:22.515
And that's good
for all of us.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.784
Now, we need Congress
to do its part to

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.053
boost the
economy, as well.

00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:30.757
Unfortunately, Congress left
town for five full weeks - and

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.760
they left behind a stack
of unfinished business.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.995
For the first time ever,
Congress failed to

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:38.631
reauthorize the
Export-Import Bank.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.401
That left thousands of business
owners and their employees

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:43.970
at a serious disadvantage
compared to their

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.206
competitors overseas.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:47.974
That's not good for jobs.

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.008
It's not good for our economy.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.979
When it returns from recess,
reauthorizing the bank ought

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.117
to be a top agenda for
members of Congress.

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:01.387
Congress also hasn't passed a
budget - and when they return

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:04.724
from vacation, they'll only have
a few weeks to do so, or shut

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:08.261
down the government for the
second time in two years.

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:10.330
They've had all
year to do this.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.233
Months ago, I put forward a
detailed plan to strengthen our

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.902
economy and our national
security in a fiscally

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.637
responsible way.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:20.807
And for months, I've said I
will veto any budget that locks

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:24.878
in the sequester-those
senseless cuts to domestic

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:27.247
and national
security priorities.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.916
Remember, we can't cut
our way to prosperity.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.918
We should be investing
in things that help our

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:35.555
economy grow today and
tomorrow, like education

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:39.292
or infrastructure or
scientific research.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.594
Democrats in Congress have made
it clear they're ready to sit

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:45.031
down and work with Republicans
to find common ground on this.

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:48.067
After all, Americans expect
Congress to help keep our

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:51.104
country strong and growing
- not threaten to shut

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.639
down our government.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.475
When Congress gets back, they
should prevent a shutdown,

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:58.444
pass a responsible budget,
and prove that this is a

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:01.347
country that looks forward
- a country that invests in

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:03.850
our future, and keeps
our economy growing for

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.552
all Americans.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:07.921
Thanks, everybody and
have a great weekend.
