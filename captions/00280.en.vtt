00:00:08.452 --> 00:00:11.619
The President:
This week, many of our largest corporations reported robust

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.753
earnings -- a positive
sign of growth.

00:00:14.753 --> 00:00:16.985
But too many of our small
business owners and those who

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:21.119
aspire to start their own small
businesses continue to struggle,

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.519
in part because they can't get
the credit they need to start

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.819
up, grow, and hire.

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.219
And too many Americans whose
livelihoods have fallen prey to

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:30.386
the worst recession
in our lifetimes --

00:00:30.386 --> 00:00:33.486
a recession that cost our
economy eight million jobs --

00:00:33.486 --> 00:00:36.486
still wonder how
they'll make ends meet.

00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:40.185
That's why we need to take new,
commonsense steps to help small

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:43.886
businesses, grow our
economy, and create jobs --

00:00:43.886 --> 00:00:46.286
and we need to take them now.

00:00:46.286 --> 00:00:49.286
For months, that's what
we've been trying to do.

00:00:49.286 --> 00:00:51.786
But too often, the Republican
leadership in the United States

00:00:51.786 --> 00:00:56.853
Senate chooses to filibuster
our recovery and obstruct our progress.

00:00:56.853 --> 00:00:59.486
And that has very
real consequences.

00:00:59.486 --> 00:01:03.019
Consider what this obstruction
means for our small businesses

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.653
-- the growth engines that create two of every three new

00:01:06.653 --> 00:01:08.586
jobs in this country.

00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:11.052
A lot of small businesses still
have trouble getting the loans

00:01:11.052 --> 00:01:14.386
and capital they need to keep
their doors open and hire new workers.

00:01:14.386 --> 00:01:18.019
So we proposed steps to get them
that help: Eliminating capital

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:20.185
gains taxes on investments.

00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:23.985
Establishing a fund for
small lenders to help small businesses.

00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:27.919
Enhancing successful SBA
programs that help them access

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:30.352
the capital they need.

00:01:30.352 --> 00:01:33.786
But again and again, a partisan
minority in the Senate said

00:01:33.786 --> 00:01:37.419
"no," and used procedural
tactics to block a simple,

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:39.786
up-or-down vote.

00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:42.319
Think about what these stalling
tactics mean for the millions of

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.019
Americans who've lost their
jobs since the recession began.

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:48.719
Over the past several weeks,
more than two million of them

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.019
have seen their unemployment
insurance expire.

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:55.352
For many, it was the only way to
make ends meet while searching

00:01:55.352 --> 00:02:00.985
for work -- the only way to cover rent, utilities, even food.

00:02:00.985 --> 00:02:04.452
Three times, the Senate has
tried to temporarily extend that

00:02:04.452 --> 00:02:06.352
emergency assistance.

00:02:06.352 --> 00:02:09.319
And three times, a
minority of Senators --

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.419
basically the same crowd who
said "no" to small businesses --

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:14.552
said "no" to folks
looking for work,

00:02:14.552 --> 00:02:17.653
and blocked a straight
up-or-down vote.

00:02:17.653 --> 00:02:19.886
Some Republican leaders actually
treat this unemployment

00:02:19.886 --> 00:02:23.019
insurance as if it's
a form of welfare.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.152
They say it discourages
folks from looking for work.

00:02:26.152 --> 00:02:28.686
Well, I've met a lot of folks
looking for work these past few

00:02:28.686 --> 00:02:31.853
years, and I can tell you, I
haven't met any American who

00:02:31.853 --> 00:02:34.519
would rather have an
unemployment check than a

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.919
meaningful job that lets you
provide for your family.

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.519
And we all have
friends, or neighbors,

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.519
or family members who already
know how hard it is to land a

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.519
job when five workers are
competing for every opening.

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.386
Now in the past, Presidents and
Congresses of both parties have

00:02:51.386 --> 00:02:53.985
treated unemployment
insurance for what it is --

00:02:53.985 --> 00:02:56.152
an emergency expenditure.

00:02:56.152 --> 00:02:59.152
That's because an economic
disaster can devastate families

00:02:59.152 --> 00:03:03.486
and communities just as
surely as a flood or tornado.

00:03:03.486 --> 00:03:06.619
But suddenly, Republican
leaders want to change that.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.919
They say we shouldn't provide
unemployment insurance because

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.686
it costs money.

00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:13.653
So after years of championing
policies that turned a record

00:03:13.653 --> 00:03:17.985
surplus into a massive deficit,
including a tax cut for the

00:03:17.985 --> 00:03:20.786
wealthiest Americans, they've
finally decided to make their

00:03:20.786 --> 00:03:23.985
stand on the backs
of the unemployed.

00:03:23.985 --> 00:03:26.352
They've got no problem spending
money on tax breaks for folks at

00:03:26.352 --> 00:03:29.486
the top who don't need them
and didn't even ask for them;

00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:32.619
but they object to helping folks
laid off in this recession who

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:34.819
really do need help.

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.586
And every day this goes on, another 50,000 Americans lose

00:03:38.586 --> 00:03:41.452
that badly needed lifeline.

00:03:41.452 --> 00:03:43.753
Well, I think these
Senators are wrong.

00:03:43.753 --> 00:03:46.753
We can't afford to go back to
the same misguided policies that

00:03:46.753 --> 00:03:48.886
led us into this mess.

00:03:48.886 --> 00:03:51.952
We need to move forward with the
policies that are leading us out

00:03:51.952 --> 00:03:53.686
of this mess.

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:56.653
The fact is, most economists
agree that extending

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:59.486
unemployment insurance is one of
the single most cost-effective

00:03:59.486 --> 00:04:02.819
ways to help
jumpstart the economy.

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.586
It puts money into the pockets
of folks who not only need it

00:04:05.586 --> 00:04:09.586
most, but who are also most
likely to spend it quickly.

00:04:09.586 --> 00:04:11.386
That boosts local economies.

00:04:11.386 --> 00:04:13.886
And that means jobs.

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.286
Increasing loans
to small business.

00:04:16.286 --> 00:04:18.219
Renewing unemployment insurance.

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:20.919
These steps aren't just the
right thing to do for those

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.252
hardest hit by the recession -- they're the right thing to do

00:04:24.252 --> 00:04:25.686
for all of us.

00:04:25.686 --> 00:04:29.019
And I'm calling on Congress once
more to take these steps on

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:32.152
behalf of America's
workers, and their families,

00:04:32.152 --> 00:04:36.786
and small business owners --
the people we were sent here to serve.

00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:39.219
Because when storms
strike Main Street,

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:41.719
we don't play politics
with emergency aid.

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.352
We don't desert our fellow
Americans when they fall on hard times.

00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:46.552
We come together.

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:48.286
We do what we can to help.

00:04:48.286 --> 00:04:51.853
We rebuild stronger,
and we move forward.

00:04:51.853 --> 00:04:53.786
That's what we're doing today.

00:04:53.786 --> 00:04:56.119
And I'm absolutely convinced
that's how we're going to come

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:59.019
through this storm
to better days ahead.

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:00.519
Thanks.
