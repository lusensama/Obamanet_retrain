00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:10.094
The President:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:10.094 --> 00:00:12.628
This week, I traveled across
the country to talk about my

00:00:12.628 --> 00:00:15.594
all-of-the-above energy
strategy for America --

00:00:15.594 --> 00:00:18.761
a strategy where we produce
more oil and gas here at home,

00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:22.027
but also more biofuels
and fuel-efficient cars;

00:00:22.027 --> 00:00:25.728
more solar power and wind power
and other sources of clean,

00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:27.728
renewable energy.

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.861
Now, you wouldn't know it by
listening to some of the folks

00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:31.761
running for office
out there today,

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:34.194
but producing more
oil at home has been,

00:00:34.194 --> 00:00:37.994
and will continue to be, a key
part of my energy strategy.

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:41.161
Under my Administration, we're
producing more oil than at any

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:43.661
other time in the
last eight years.

00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:46.394
We've quadrupled the number
of operating oil rigs to a

00:00:46.394 --> 00:00:47.394
record high.

00:00:47.394 --> 00:00:50.528
And we've added enough oil
and gas pipeline to circle the

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:52.928
entire Earth and then some.

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:54.761
Those are the facts.

00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:56.561
But as I've been
saying all week,

00:00:56.561 --> 00:00:59.795
even though America uses
around 20% of the world's oil,

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:03.695
we only have around 2% of the
world's known oil reserves.

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:05.428
So even if we
drilled everywhere,

00:01:05.428 --> 00:01:08.928
we'd still be relying on
other countries for oil.

00:01:08.928 --> 00:01:11.695
That's why we're pursuing an
all-of-the-above strategy.

00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:13.861
We're producing more biofuels.

00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:15.661
More fuel-efficient cars.

00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:16.828
More solar power.

00:01:16.828 --> 00:01:18.394
More wind power.

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:20.394
This week, I was in
Boulder City, Nevada,

00:01:20.394 --> 00:01:23.461
where they've got the largest
solar plant of its kind anywhere

00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:24.795
in the country.

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:26.361
That's the future.

00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:28.928
I was at Ohio State University,
where they've developed the

00:01:28.928 --> 00:01:31.227
fastest electric
car in the world.

00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:32.695
That's the future.

00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:35.628
I don't want to cede these clean
energy industries to China or

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.561
Germany or some other country.

00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:40.261
I want to see solar panels and
wind turbines and fuel-efficient

00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:45.328
cars manufactured right here,
in America, by American workers.

00:01:45.328 --> 00:01:48.127
Now, getting these clean energy
industries to locate here

00:01:48.127 --> 00:01:50.961
requires us to maintain a
national commitment to new

00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:52.594
research and development.

00:01:52.594 --> 00:01:55.628
But it also requires us to build
world-class transportation and

00:01:55.628 --> 00:01:59.127
communications networks, so that
any company can move goods and

00:01:59.127 --> 00:02:02.294
sell products all around the
world as quickly and efficiently

00:02:02.294 --> 00:02:03.761
as possible.

00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:06.895
So much of America needs
to be rebuilt right now.

00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:08.994
We've got crumbling
roads and bridges.

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:11.728
A power grid that
wastes too much energy.

00:02:11.728 --> 00:02:14.594
An incomplete high-speed
broadband network.

00:02:14.594 --> 00:02:17.394
And we've got thousands of
unemployed construction workers

00:02:17.394 --> 00:02:19.661
who've been looking for a
job ever since the housing

00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:21.561
market collapsed.

00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:23.961
But once again, we're
waiting on Congress.

00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:26.895
You see, in a matter of days,
funding will stop for all sorts

00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:29.127
of transportation projects.

00:02:29.127 --> 00:02:31.061
Construction sites will go idle.

00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:32.928
Workers will have to go home.

00:02:32.928 --> 00:02:35.528
And our economy will take a hit.

00:02:35.528 --> 00:02:38.027
This Congress cannot
let that happen.

00:02:38.027 --> 00:02:40.795
Not at a time when we should be
doing everything in our power --

00:02:40.795 --> 00:02:43.528
Democrats and Republicans
-- to keep this recovery

00:02:43.528 --> 00:02:45.094
moving forward.

00:02:45.094 --> 00:02:46.928
The Senate did their part.

00:02:46.928 --> 00:02:49.728
They passed a bipartisan
transportation bill.

00:02:49.728 --> 00:02:53.761
It had the support of 52
Democrats and 22 Republicans.

00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:56.328
Now it's up to the
House to follow suit;

00:02:56.328 --> 00:02:59.294
to put aside partisan
posturing, end the gridlock,

00:02:59.294 --> 00:03:01.594
and do what's right for
the American people.

00:03:01.594 --> 00:03:03.361
This is common sense.

00:03:03.361 --> 00:03:04.795
Right now, all
across this country,

00:03:04.795 --> 00:03:07.294
we've got contractors and
construction workers who have

00:03:07.294 --> 00:03:10.161
never been more eager
to get back on the job.

00:03:10.161 --> 00:03:13.428
A long term transportation
bill would put them to work.

00:03:13.428 --> 00:03:15.094
And those are good jobs.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.594
We just released a report
that shows nearly 90% of the

00:03:17.594 --> 00:03:20.994
construction, manufacturing
and trade jobs created through

00:03:20.994 --> 00:03:24.928
investments in transportation
projects are middle class jobs.

00:03:24.928 --> 00:03:27.494
Those are exactly the
jobs we need right now,

00:03:27.494 --> 00:03:31.494
and they'll make the economy
stronger for everybody.

00:03:31.494 --> 00:03:33.127
We've done this before.

00:03:33.127 --> 00:03:35.961
During the Great Depression,
America built the Hoover Dam and

00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:37.528
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:03:37.528 --> 00:03:40.061
After World War II, we connected
our states with a system

00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:41.428
of highways.

00:03:41.428 --> 00:03:44.328
Democratic and Republican
administrations invested in

00:03:44.328 --> 00:03:47.328
great projects that
benefited everybody,

00:03:47.328 --> 00:03:49.861
from the workers who actually
built them to the businesses

00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:52.027
that still use them today.

00:03:52.027 --> 00:03:55.294
So tell Congress that if we
invest in new technology and new

00:03:55.294 --> 00:03:58.795
energy; in new roads and bridges
and construction projects,

00:03:58.795 --> 00:04:02.094
we can keep growing our economy,
put our people back to work,

00:04:02.094 --> 00:04:04.828
and remind the world why the
United States is the greatest

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.261
nation on Earth.

00:04:06.261 --> 00:04:07.761
Thanks and have a great weekend.
