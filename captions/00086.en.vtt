00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:11.736
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:13.971
Over the past 52 months,
our businesses have

00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:16.741
created nearly 10
million new jobs.

00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:18.743
The unemployment rate has
fallen to its lowest

00:00:18.743 --> 00:00:21.646
point since 2008.

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:24.415
Across lots of areas --
energy, manufacturing,

00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:27.251
technology -- our
businesses and workers

00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:28.920
are leading again.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.222
In fact, for the first
time in over a decade,

00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:33.758
business leaders
worldwide have declared

00:00:33.758 --> 00:00:36.394
that China is no longer
the world's best place

00:00:36.394 --> 00:00:39.964
to invest -- America is.

00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:42.333
None of this
is an accident.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.602
It's thanks to your
resilience, resolve,

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:47.271
and hard work that America
has recovered faster

00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:49.774
and come farther than
almost any other advanced

00:00:49.774 --> 00:00:51.609
country on Earth.

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.611
Now we have the
opportunity to ensure

00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:56.280
that this growth is
broadly shared.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.282
Our economy grows best not
from the top down,

00:00:58.282 --> 00:01:00.118
but from the middle out.

00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:03.087
We do better when the
middle class does better.

00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:05.089
So we have to make sure
that we're not just

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.892
creating more jobs, but
raising middle-class

00:01:07.892 --> 00:01:10.161
wages and incomes.

00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:12.163
We have to make sure our
economy works

00:01:12.163 --> 00:01:14.499
for every working American.

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:17.068
My opportunity
agenda does that.

00:01:17.068 --> 00:01:19.637
It's built on creating
more jobs, training more

00:01:19.637 --> 00:01:22.874
workers, educating
all our kids, and making

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:26.144
sure your hard work pays
off with higher wages

00:01:26.144 --> 00:01:27.879
and better benefits.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.348
On Thursday, I traveled to
Delaware to highlight

00:01:30.348 --> 00:01:32.683
how we're trying to create
more good, middle-class

00:01:32.683 --> 00:01:35.686
jobs rebuilding America:
rebuilding roads

00:01:35.686 --> 00:01:38.723
and bridges, ports and
airports, high-speed

00:01:38.723 --> 00:01:41.826
rail, and high-speed Internet.

00:01:41.826 --> 00:01:43.828
This week, Vice President
Biden will release

00:01:43.828 --> 00:01:46.297
a report he's been
working on to reform

00:01:46.297 --> 00:01:47.698
our job training system

00:01:47.698 --> 00:01:50.568
into a job-driven
training system.

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:52.570
And I'll visit a
community college in L.A.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.572
that's retraining
workers for careers

00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:56.574
in the fast-growing
health care sector.

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:58.075
Because every worker
deserves to know

00:01:58.075 --> 00:02:00.611
that if you lose your
job, your country will

00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:03.681
help you train for an
even better one.

00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:05.683
In recent days, both
parties in Congress

00:02:05.683 --> 00:02:07.685
have taken some good
steps in these areas.

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:10.021
But we can do so much more
for the middle class,

00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:12.824
and for folks working to
join the middle class.

00:02:12.824 --> 00:02:14.826
We should raise the
minimum wage so that

00:02:14.826 --> 00:02:17.161
no one who works full-time
has to live in poverty.

00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:21.065
We should fight for fair
pay and paid family leave.

00:02:21.065 --> 00:02:23.301
We should pass common sense
immigration reform

00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:25.770
that strengthens our
borders and our businesses,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.039
and includes a chance for
long-time residents

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:30.274
to earn their citizenship.

00:02:30.274 --> 00:02:32.276
I want to work with
Democrats and Republicans

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:33.845
on all of these priorities.

00:02:33.845 --> 00:02:36.380
But I will do whatever
I can, whenever I can,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.382
to help families like yours.

00:02:38.382 --> 00:02:40.351
Because nothing's more
important to me than

00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:43.421
you -- your hopes, your
concerns, and making sure

00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:45.957
this country remains the
place where everyone

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:49.227
who works hard can
make it if you try.

00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:51.229
Thanks so much, and
have a great weekend.
