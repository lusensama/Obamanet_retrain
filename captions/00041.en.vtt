00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.460
The President: Hi everybody.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.540
Five years
ago, we finally declared

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:17.183
that in America, health care
is not a privilege for a few,

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.918
but a right for all.

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.788
And this week, after more
than fifty votes in Congress

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:25.392
to repeal or weaken this
law; after a Presidential

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.328
election based in part on
preserving or repealing this

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:31.364
law; after multiple
challenges to this law

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:32.599
before the Supreme Court,
we can now say this for

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.037
certain: the Affordable Care
Act still stands, it is

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:41.608
working, and it
is here to stay.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:44.077
On Thursday, when the Court
upheld a critical part of

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.546
the Affordable Care Act,
it was a victory for

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.315
hardworking Americans all
across this country whose

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:52.652
lives are more secure
because of this law.

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:54.654
This law means that if
you're a parent, you can

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:58.391
keep your kids on your
plan until they turn 26.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.060
If you're a senior, or an
American with a disability,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.831
this law gives you discounts
on your prescriptions.

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.500
You can't be charged more
just because you're a woman.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.936
And you can't be
discriminated against just

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:12.906
for having a
pre-existing condition.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:16.376
This law is working exactly
as it's supposed to - and in

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:19.512
some ways, better than
we expected it to.

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.981
So far more than 16 million
uninsured Americans

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:23.683
have gained coverage.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:26.252
Nearly one in three
Americans who was uninsured

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:29.189
a few years ago
is insured today.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.325
The uninsured rate in
America is the lowest since

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:35.128
we began to keep
such records.

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.297
The law has helped hold the
price of health care to its

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:40.033
slowest growth in 50 years.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.135
If your family gets
insurance through the

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:45.705
workplace, not through the
Affordable Care Act, you're

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:49.175
paying about $1,800 less per
year on average than you

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:52.579
would be if trends before
this law had continued -

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.782
which is good for workers
and it's good for the

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.650
economy.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.487
The point is, this is not
some abstract political

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:01.488
debate.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.990
For all the misinformation
campaigns, and doomsday

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.594
predictions; for all the
talk of death panels and job

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:10.830
destruction; for all
the repeal attempts -

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.301
this law is helping tens
of millions of Americans.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.303
This isn't just
about Obamacare.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:21.307
This is health
care in America.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.843
With this case behind us,
we're going to keep working

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:26.145
to make health care in
America even better and

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:30.083
more affordable, and to
get more people covered.

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:32.118
But it is time to stop
refighting battles

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:34.120
that have been settled
again and again.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.989
It's time to move on.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.391
Because as Americans,
we don't go backwards,

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.360
we move forwards.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.928
We take care
of each other.

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:44.397
We root for one
another's success.

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:47.467
We strive to do better,
to be better, than the

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:50.036
generation before us, and
we try to build something

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:53.907
better for the generation
coming behind us.

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:56.409
With this behind us, let's
come together and keep

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.345
building something
better right now.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.347
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
