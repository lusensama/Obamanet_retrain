00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:10.094
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.094 --> 00:00:11.261
Over the past four
and a half years,

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:13.928
we've been fighting our way 
back from an economic crisis

00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:15.294
and punishing recession

00:00:15.294 --> 00:00:18.294
that cost millions of Americans
their jobs, their homes,

00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:21.394
and the sense of security
they'd worked so hard to build.

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:23.161
But thanks to the grit
and determination

00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:24.561
of the American people,

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:25.928
our businesses have now created

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:29.528
nearly 7 million new jobs
over the past 38 months.

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:31.094
An auto industry
that was flatlining

00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:34.294
is once again the heartbeat
of American manufacturing -

00:00:34.294 --> 00:00:37.961
with Americans buying more cars
than we have in five years.

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:39.928
Within the next few months,
we're projected to begin

00:00:39.928 --> 00:00:42.528
producing more of our
own crude oil at home

00:00:42.528 --> 00:00:44.928
than we buy
from other countries -

00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:47.994
the first time that's
happened in 16 years.

00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:50.328
Deficits that were growing
for years are now shrinking

00:00:50.328 --> 00:00:52.394
at the fastest rate in decades.

00:00:52.394 --> 00:00:54.628
The rise of health care
costs is slowing, too.

00:00:54.628 --> 00:00:56.761
And a housing market
that was in tatters

00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:59.127
is showing new signs
of real strength.

00:00:59.127 --> 00:01:00.361
Sales are rising.

00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:01.928
Foreclosures are declining.

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:03.428
Construction is expanding.

00:01:03.428 --> 00:01:04.895
And home prices that are rising

00:01:04.895 --> 00:01:06.895
at the fastest rate
in nearly seven years

00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:10.261
are helping a lot of families
breathe a lot easier.

00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:12.428
Now we need to do more.

00:01:12.428 --> 00:01:14.661
This week, my administration
announced that we're extending

00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:16.928
a program to help 
more responsible families

00:01:16.928 --> 00:01:20.728
modify their mortgages 
so they can stay in their homes.

00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:23.528
But to keep our housing market
and our economy growing,

00:01:23.528 --> 00:01:26.428
Congress needs to step
up and do its part.

00:01:26.428 --> 00:01:28.628
Members of Congress will be
coming back next week

00:01:28.628 --> 00:01:30.695
for an important month of work.

00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:32.461
We've got to keep
this progress going

00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:33.828
until middle-class families

00:01:33.828 --> 00:01:36.227
start regaining
that sense of security.

00:01:36.227 --> 00:01:39.761
And we can't let partisan
politics get in the way.

00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:41.127
Congress should pass a law

00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:43.194
giving every responsible 
homeowner the chance

00:01:43.194 --> 00:01:47.127
to save about $3,000 a year
on their mortgage

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:49.994
by refinancing at historically
low interest rates.

00:01:49.994 --> 00:01:52.094
Congress should put
more Americans to work

00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:54.194
rebuilding our crumbling
roads and bridges,

00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:57.161
like the one that collapsed
last week in Washington state.

00:01:57.161 --> 00:01:58.394
We'd all be safer,

00:01:58.394 --> 00:02:00.661
and the unemployment rate
would fall faster.

00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:03.361
And Congress should fix our
broken immigration system

00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:06.127
by passing commonsense
reform that continues

00:02:06.127 --> 00:02:09.328
to strengthen our borders;
holds employers accountable;

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:12.161
provides a pathway to
earned citizenship;

00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:14.661
and also modernizes our
legal immigration system

00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:16.994
so that we're reuniting
families and attracting

00:02:16.994 --> 00:02:18.828
the highly-skilled
entrepreneurs and engineers

00:02:18.828 --> 00:02:21.294
who will help our economy grow.

00:02:21.294 --> 00:02:23.561
So there are a lot of reasons
to feel optimistic

00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:25.494
about where we're
headed as a country -

00:02:25.494 --> 00:02:27.961
especially after all we've 
fought through together.

00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:29.895
We've just got to keep going.

00:02:29.895 --> 00:02:31.994
Because we've got more
good jobs to create.

00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:33.661
We've got more kids to educate.

00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:36.594
We've got more doors of
opportunity to open for anyone

00:02:36.594 --> 00:02:38.261
who's willing
to work hard enough

00:02:38.261 --> 00:02:40.161
to walk through those doors.

00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:41.561
And if we work together,

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:43.494
I'm as confident
as I've ever been

00:02:43.494 --> 00:02:45.928
that we'll get to
where we need to be.

00:02:45.928 --> 00:02:47.994
Thanks and have a great weekend.
