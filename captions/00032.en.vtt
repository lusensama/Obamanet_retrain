00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:10.677
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:14.247
This Monday, I'm heading to
Alaska for a three-day tour

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.515
of the state.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.118
I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.120
Not only because Alaska is
one of the most beautiful

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.390
places in a country that's
full of beautiful places -

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.725
but because I'll have
several opportunities to

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.727
meet with everyday Alaskans
about what's going

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:29.262
on in their lives.

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:31.998
I'll travel throughout the
state, meeting with Alaskans

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:35.635
who live above the Arctic
Circle, with Alaska natives,

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:37.637
and with folks who earn
their livelihoods through

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:39.105
fishing and tourism.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.441
And I expect to learn a lot.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.943
One thing I've learned so
far is that a lot of these

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:47.347
conversations begin
with climate change.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:49.382
And that's because Alaskans
are already living

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.084
with its effects.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.953
More frequent and
extensive wildfires.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.990
Bigger storm surges as
sea ice melts faster.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.526
Some of the swiftest
shoreline erosion in the

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:03.596
world - in some places, more
than three feet a year.

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:05.899
Alaska's glaciers are
melting faster too,

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.435
threatening tourism and
adding to rising seas.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:11.371
And if we do nothing,
Alaskan temperatures are

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.207
projected to rise between
six and twelve degrees by

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.910
the end of the century,
changing all sorts of

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.412
industries forever.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.281
This is all real.

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:24.784
This is happening to our
fellow Americans right now.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.754
In fact, Alaska's governor
recently told me that four

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.023
villages are in "imminent
danger" and have

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:31.858
to be relocated.

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:34.427
Already, rising sea levels
are beginning to swallow

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.896
one island community.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.498
Think about that.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.500
If another country
threatened to wipe out

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.535
an American town, we'd do
everything in our power

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.404
to protect ourselves.

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:48.241
Climate change poses the
same threat, right now.

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:50.243
That's why one of the things
I'll do while I'm in Alaska

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:53.146
is to convene other nations
to meet this threat.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:56.082
Several Arctic nations have
already committed to action.

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:58.485
Since the United States and
China worked together to set

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:01.454
ambitious climate targets
last year, leading by

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:04.457
example, many of the world's
biggest emitters have come

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.926
forward with new climate
plans of their own.

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:09.095
And that's a good sign as we
approach this December's

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:12.432
global climate
negotiations in Paris.

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.634
Now, one of the ways
America is leading is by

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:17.103
transitioning away from
dirty energy sources that

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.739
threaten our health and our
environment, and by going

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.876
all-in on clean, renewable
energy sources like wind

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.143
and solar.

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:26.880
And Alaska has the natural
resources to be a global

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.781
leader in this effort.

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:31.451
Now even as we accelerate
this transition, our

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:34.287
economy still has to
rely on oil and gas.

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.289
As long as that's the case,
I believe we should rely

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.425
more on domestic production
than on foreign imports, and

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.794
we should demand the highest
safety standards in the

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:44.430
industry - our own.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.499
Still, I know there are
Americans who are concerned

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.501
about oil companies
drilling in environmentally

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:49.936
sensitive waters.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.272
Some are also concerned with
my administration's decision

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:54.908
to approve Shell's
application to drill a well

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:58.278
off the Alaskan coast, using
leases they purchased before

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.913
I took office.

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:02.248
I share people's concerns
about offshore drilling.

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:04.250
I remember the BP
spill in the Gulf of

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.919
Mexico all too well.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.354
That's precisely why my
administration has worked to

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.090
make sure that our oil
exploration conducted under

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.228
these leases is done at the
highest standards possible,

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:17.297
with requirements
specifically tailored to

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:20.266
the risks of
drilling off Alaska.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.668
We don't rubber-stamp
permits.

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:25.271
We made it clear that Shell
has to meet our high

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:28.074
standards in how they
conduct their operations -

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:30.843
and it's a testament to how
rigorous we've applied those

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:33.279
standards that Shell has
delayed and limited its

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.249
exploration off Alaska while
trying to meet them.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:39.352
The bottom line is, safety
has been and will continue

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:41.854
to be my administration's
top priority when it comes

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:44.958
to oil and gas exploration
off America's precious

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.861
coasts - even as we push our
economy and the world to

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:52.765
ultimately transition off of
fossil fuels.

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:54.901
So I'm looking forward
to talking with Alaskans

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.370
about how we can work together
to make America the global

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.472
leader on climate change
around the globe.

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:02.108
And we're going to offer
unique and engaging ways for

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:04.844
you to join me on
this trip all week at

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:05.845
WhiteHouse.gov/Alaska.

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:10.783
Because what's happening in
Alaska is happening to us.

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:11.784
It's our wakeup call.

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:14.387
And as long as I'm
President, America will lead

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:16.923
the world to meet the threat
of climate change before

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.725
it's too late.

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:20.727
Thanks, and have a
great weekend.
