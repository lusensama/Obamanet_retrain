00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:07.033
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:10.066
As I've said before, my top
priority as President is making

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:13.233
sure we do everything we can
to reignite the true engine of

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:17.734
America's economic growth -- a
rising, thriving middle class.

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:20.934
Yesterday, we received some
welcome news on that front.

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:24.633
We learned that our businesses
added nearly 250,000 new

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:26.300
jobs last month.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.867
The unemployment
rate fell to 7.7% --

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:33.867
still too high, but now lower
than it was when I took office.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.533
Our businesses have created
jobs every month for three years

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:42.200
straight -- nearly 6.4
million new jobs in all.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.100
Our manufacturers are
bringing jobs back to America.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.367
Our stock market has rebounded.

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:51.033
New homes are being built
and sold at a faster pace.

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:55.433
And we need to do everything we
can to keep that momentum going.

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:59.066
That means asking ourselves
three questions every day:

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:02.166
How do we make America
a magnet for new jobs?

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.867
How do we equip more of our
people with the skills those

00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:06.467
jobs require?

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:09.500
And how do we make sure that
your hard work leads to a

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.967
decent living?

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:14.567
That has to be our driving
focus -- our North Star.

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:16.734
And at a time when our
businesses are gaining a little

00:01:16.734 --> 00:01:20.166
more traction, the last thing
we should do is allow Washington

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.600
politics to get in the way.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.700
You deserve better than the same
political gridlock and refusal

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.900
to compromise that has too often
passed for serious debate over

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.667
the last few years.

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:34.300
That's why I've been reaching
out to Republicans and Democrats

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.533
to see if we can untangle
some of the gridlock.

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:40.000
Earlier this week, for example,
I met with some Republican

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.133
Senators to see if there were
smarter ways to grow our economy

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:46.467
and reduce our deficits than the
arbitrary cuts and the so-called

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:49.667
"sequester" that
recently went into place.

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:52.033
We had an open and honest
conversation about critical

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:54.767
issues like immigration
reform and gun violence,

00:01:54.767 --> 00:01:57.333
and other areas where we can
work together to move this

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:58.900
country forward.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.033
And next week, I'll attend both
the Democratic and Republican

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:06.600
party meetings in the Capitol
to continue those discussions.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.767
The fact is, America is a
nation of different beliefs and

00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:11.567
different points of view.

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:14.066
That's part of what makes
us strong, and frankly,

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:17.834
makes our democratic debates
sometimes messy and a lot of

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:19.567
times, pretty frustrating.

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:22.266
But ultimately what makes us
special is when we summon the

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:24.567
ability to see past
those differences,

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:26.834
and come together around the
belief that what binds us

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:29.467
together will always be more
powerful than what drives

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:31.033
us apart.

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:34.333
As Democrats and Republicans, we
may disagree on the best way to

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:37.433
achieve our goals, but I'm
confident we can agree on what

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:39.333
those goals should be.

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:41.500
A strong and vibrant
middle class.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.934
An economy that allows
businesses to grow and thrive.

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:47.800
An education system that gives
more Americans the skills they

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.333
need to compete for
the jobs of the future.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:53.133
An immigration system that
actually works for families

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:54.567
and businesses.

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:58.867
Stronger communities and safer
streets for our children.

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:01.667
Making progress on these
issues won't be easy.

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:04.767
In the months ahead, there will
be more contentious debate and

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:07.734
honest disagreement between
principled people who want

00:03:07.734 --> 00:03:09.767
what's best for this country.

00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:12.333
But I still believe that
compromise is possible.

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:15.066
I still believe we can come
together to do big things.

00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:18.500
And I know there are leaders on
the other side of the aisle who

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.100
share that belief.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.500
So I'll keep fighting to solve
the real challenges facing

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.734
middle-class families.

00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:26.467
And I'll enlist anyone
who is willing to help.

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:28.200
That's what this
country needs now --

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.200
and that's what you deserve.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200
Thanks so much.
