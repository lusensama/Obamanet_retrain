00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.800
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.166
This week, I traveled to
New England, where I was

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.367
joined by four governors
who are working to raise

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:17.567
the minimum wage in
each of their states.

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:19.667
And they've also joined me
in calling on Congress

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:20.967
to raise the minimum wage
from

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:26.000
$7.25 to $10.10 an hour.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.834
Because it would give
nearly 800,000 Americans

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:31.734
in their states a raise -
and lift wages for about

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:34.133
28 million across
the country.

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.033
So these governors aren't
waiting for Congress

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:38.567
to make up its mind.

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:40.500
And in my State of the
Union Address, I asked

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.300
America's business leaders
to go ahead and do what

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.633
they could to raise their
employees' wages, too.

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:48.767
And increasingly, it's not
just large companies

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:51.066
like Costco or the Gap that
choose to pay their

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.133
employees higher
starting wages.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.033
It's smaller businesses
like Jaxson's,

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:58.967
a family-owned ice cream
parlor in South Florida.

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:01.100
They answered the call and
raised their wages so that

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.233
more than 70 employees
would earn at least $10.10

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:07.033
an hour, without
cutting back on hiring.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.900
And two weeks ago, an
Atlanta small business

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.533
owner named Darien
Southerland

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.133
wrote me to share a lesson
his grandmother taught him

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.333
- that if you treat your
employees right,

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.967
they'll treat you right.

00:01:17.967 --> 00:01:19.700
And Vice President Biden
paid

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.700
him a visit this week.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.967
I agree with these
business owners,

00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:25.467
which is why I issued an
executive order requiring

00:01:25.467 --> 00:01:28.233
federal contractors to pay their
employees a fair wage

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:30.800
of at least $10.10 an hour.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.233
It's good for
our bottom line.

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:34.567
And working Americans have
struggled through stagnant

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:35.900
wages for far too long.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.066
A clear majority of
Americans support raising

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.500
the minimum wage, because
we believe that nobody

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.633
who works full-time should
have to live in poverty.

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:46.967
About half of all
Republicans support

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:49.200
raising the
minimum wage, too.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.533
It's just too bad they
don't serve in Congress.

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.367
Because the Republicans
who do serve in Congress

00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:57.266
don't want to vote on
the minimum wage at all.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:59.000
Some even want to get
rid of it completely.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.133
Seriously.

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.266
That's why what business
leaders and everyday

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:05.266
Americans are doing
to raise wages

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:06.700
is so important.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.734
Because change doesn't
come from Washington -

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:10.934
change comes
to Washington.

00:02:10.934 --> 00:02:12.467
I've always believed that,
and it's true

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:14.133
in this case, too.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.033
Outside Washington,
Americans are ready

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:18.133
to put aside old political
arguments

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:20.100
and move this country forward.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.033
The American people are
way ahead of Congress

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:23.734
on this issue, and we've just

00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:25.900
got to let Congress know that.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.867
It's time for "ten-ten."

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:29.533
It's time to give
America a raise.

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:32.700
And it's time to restore
opportunity for all.

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:35.367
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
