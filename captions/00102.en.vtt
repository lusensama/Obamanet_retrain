00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.166
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:13.900
In this year of action,
I'm doing everything

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.600
I can, with or without
Congress, to expand

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.700
opportunity for
more Americans.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.867
This week, I ordered a
review of our nation's

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:24.567
overtime rules, to give
more Americans the chance

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:28.233
to earn the overtime
pay they've worked for.

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:29.567
Here's why this matters.

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:32.200
Our businesses have
created 8.7 million

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.500
new jobs over the
past four years.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.600
But in many ways, the
trends that have battered

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.166
the middle class for
decades

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.266
have grown even starker.

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.266
While those at the top are
doing better than ever,

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.967
average wages have
barely budged.

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:47.266
Too many Americans are
working harder than ever

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.066
just to keep up.

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.600
We've got to build an
economy that works

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.867
for everybody, not just
a fortunate few.

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:56.000
We know from our history
that our economy grows

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.266
best from the middle out,
when growth

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.166
is more widely shared.

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.800
So we've got to restore
opportunity

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.900
for all - the idea that with
hard work and responsibility,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.500
you can get ahead.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.266
Now, for more than 75
years,

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.166
the 40-hour workweek and the
overtime protections

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.200
that come with it have helped countless

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.200
workers climb the ladder of success.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.000
But today, an overtime
exception originally meant

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.266
for highly-paid employees
now applies to workers who

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:29.800
earn as little as
$23,660 a year.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.233
It doesn't matter if you
do mostly physical labor,

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:36.400
or if you work 50, 60,
even 70 hours a week.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.166
Your employer may not have

00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:41.567
to pay you a single extra dime.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.667
In some cases, this rule
makes it possible for

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:47.200
workers earning a salary
to actually be paid less

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.233
than the minimum wage.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.800
And it means that business
owners who treat their

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.233
employees fairly can be
undercut

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:55.667
by competitors who don't.

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:57.200
That's not right.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.100
So we're going to update
those overtime rules

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.166
to restore that basic
principle that if you have

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.433
to work more, you should
be able to earn more.

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:06.900
And we'll do it by
consulting workers

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.233
and businesses, and
simplifying the system

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:12.300
so it's easier for everyone.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.934
Americans have spent too
long working more and

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.533
getting less in return.

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:19.100
So wherever and whenever
I can make sure that

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.533
our economy rewards hard work
and responsibility,

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:24.367
that's what I'm going to do.

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:26.233
Because what every
American wants

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:30.166
is a paycheck that lets them
support their families,

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:31.967
know a little economic
security,

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:36.033
and pass down some hope and
optimism to their kids.

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:37.200
That's something
worth fighting for.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.266
And I'll keep fighting

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:40.500
for it as long as I'm President.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.066
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
