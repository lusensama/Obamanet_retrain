00:00:05.858 --> 00:00:08.758
The President:
This week, we received a report
on jobs and unemployment that

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:11.692
told us we're continuing to
move in the right direction.

00:00:11.692 --> 00:00:13.692
But we need to get there faster.

00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:16.491
In the short-term, the
bipartisan tax cut we passed in

00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:19.858
December will give an added
boost to job creation and

00:00:19.858 --> 00:00:21.491
economic growth.

00:00:21.491 --> 00:00:23.525
This is a tax cut that is
already making Americans'

00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:27.191
paychecks a little bigger and
giving businesses more incentive

00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:29.491
to invest and to hire.

00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:32.591
But ultimately, our true measure
of progress has to be whether

00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:35.625
every American who wants
a job can find one;

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:38.991
whether the jobs available pay
well and offer good benefits;

00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:41.925
whether people in this country
can still achieve the American

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:45.091
Dream for themselves
and for their children.

00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:47.291
That's the progress we're after.

00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:49.858
To get there, we have to
realize that in today's global,

00:00:49.858 --> 00:00:53.858
competitive economy, the best
jobs and newest industries will

00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:56.858
take root in the countries
with the most skilled workers,

00:00:56.858 --> 00:00:59.658
the strongest commitment to
research and technology,

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:03.958
and the fastest way to move
people, goods, and information.

00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.191
To win the future, America needs
to out-educate, out-innovate,

00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:10.124
and out-build the
rest of the world.

00:01:10.124 --> 00:01:12.758
On Thursday, I went to
Penn State University,

00:01:12.758 --> 00:01:15.391
whose students and researchers
are poised to lead the way on

00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:17.758
innovation and job creation.

00:01:17.758 --> 00:01:20.158
They're taking up the challenge
we've issued to scientists and

00:01:20.158 --> 00:01:23.158
engineers all across the
country: if you assemble teams

00:01:23.158 --> 00:01:26.124
of the best minds in your field,
and focus on tackling the

00:01:26.124 --> 00:01:29.158
biggest obstacles to
providing America with clean,

00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:32.458
affordable energy, we'll
get behind your work.

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:35.491
Your government will
support your research.

00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:37.658
The folks in Pennsylvania have
decided to focus on designing

00:01:37.658 --> 00:01:39.792
buildings that
save more energy --

00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:42.291
everything from more efficient
lighting and windows to heating

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:43.625
and cooling.

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:46.224
This won't just cut down
on energy pollution,

00:01:46.224 --> 00:01:49.792
it can save us billions of
dollars on our energy bills.

00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:52.425
Most of all, discovering new
ways to make buildings more

00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:56.191
energy-efficient will lead to
new jobs and new businesses.

00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:58.725
Over the last two years, we've
seen a window manufacturer in

00:01:58.725 --> 00:02:01.892
Maryland boost business by 55%.

00:02:01.892 --> 00:02:05.591
A lighting company in North
Carolina hired hundreds of workers.

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:09.892
A manufacturer in Pennsylvania
saw business increase by $1 million.

00:02:09.892 --> 00:02:12.792
All we did for these companies
was provide some tax credits and

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:14.658
financing opportunities.

00:02:14.658 --> 00:02:17.058
And that's what we want
to do going forward,

00:02:17.058 --> 00:02:19.758
so that it's profitable for
American businesses to sell the

00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:23.958
discoveries made by scientists at Penn
State and other hubs of innovation.

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.191
If businesses sell
these discoveries --

00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:29.058
if they start making windows and
insulation and buildings that

00:02:29.058 --> 00:02:31.825
save more energy --
they'll hire more workers.

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:33.958
And that's how
Americans will prosper.

00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.258
That's how we will
win the future.

00:02:36.258 --> 00:02:38.825
Our government has an obligation
to make sure that America is the

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.958
best place on Earth
to do business --

00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.892
that we have the best schools,
the best incentives to innovate,

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:45.991
and the best infrastructure.

00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:48.124
Next week, I'll see that kind
of infrastructure when I visit

00:02:48.124 --> 00:02:51.892
Marquette, Michigan -- a place
where high-speed broadband is

00:02:51.892 --> 00:02:55.625
connecting a small town
to the larger world.

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:57.991
Supporting businesses with
this kind of 21st century

00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:02.625
infrastructure and cutting-edge
innovation is our responsibility.

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:05.325
But businesses have a
responsibility, too.

00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:07.692
If we make America the
best place to do business,

00:03:07.692 --> 00:03:11.291
businesses should make
their mark here in America.

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.458
They should set up shop
here, and hire our workers,

00:03:14.458 --> 00:03:18.825
and pay decent wages, and invest
in the future of this nation.

00:03:18.825 --> 00:03:20.491
That's their obligation.

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:22.491
And that's the message I'll be
bringing to American business

00:03:22.491 --> 00:03:25.091
leaders at the Chamber
of Commerce on Monday --

00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:28.558
that government and businesses
have mutual responsibilities;

00:03:28.558 --> 00:03:31.091
and that if we fulfill
these obligations together,

00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:33.091
it benefits us all.

00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:34.625
Our workers will succeed.

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:36.458
Our nation will prosper.

00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:39.725
And America will win the future
in this century just like we did

00:03:39.725 --> 00:03:41.124
in the last.

00:03:41.124 --> 00:03:42.558
Thanks.
