00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.266
Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.166
This week, I visited a
community college

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.600
in Florida, where I spoke
with students about what

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.333
we need to do to make sure
our economy rewards the

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.767
hard work of
every American.

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:22.033
More specifically, I spoke
about making sure our

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:25.500
economy rewards the
hard work of women.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.133
Today, women make up about
half of our workforce,

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:31.200
and more than half of our
college graduates.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.900
More women are now their
families'

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.800
main breadwinner than ever before.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.066
But in a lot of ways, our
economy hasn't caught

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.467
up to this new reality yet.

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:43.900
On average, a woman still
earns just 77 cents

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.166
for every dollar a man does.

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.367
And too many women face
outdated workplace

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:51.734
policies that hold them
back - which in turn holds

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:54.300
back our families and
our entire economy.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.033
A woman deserves to earn
equal pay for equal work,

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:01.333
and paid leave that lets
you take a day off

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.800
to care for a sick
child or parent.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.033
Congress needs to act
on these priorities.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:09.000
And when women hold
most lower-wage jobs

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.033
in America, Congress needs to
raise the minimum wage.

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:13.867
Because no woman who works
full-time should

00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:15.900
ever have to raise her
children in poverty.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.834
Now, the good news is that
in the year since

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:22.400
I first called on Congress to
raise the minimum wage,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.400
six states have passed
laws to raise theirs.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.900
More states, counties,
and cities are working

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.033
to raise their minimum
wages as we speak.

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:33.400
Small businesses like
St. Louis-based

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.100
Pi Pizzeria, are raising
their wages too -

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.567
not out of charity, but because
it's good for business.

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:41.433
And by the way, Pi makes
a really good pizza.

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:44.433
And in this year of
action, I signed an

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:46.967
executive order requiring
federal contractors to pay

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:49.433
their employees a fair
wage of at least ten

00:01:49.433 --> 00:01:50.667
dollars and ten
cents an hour.

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:53.867
But if we're truly going
to reward the hard work

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:56.300
of every American, Congress
needs to join the rest

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.900
of the country and pass a
bill that would lift the

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.100
federal minimum wage to
ten dollars

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.066
and ten cents an hour.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.834
But if we're truly going
to reward the hard work

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:06.967
of every American, Congress
needs to join the rest

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:09.433
of the country and pass a
bill that would lift the

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:11.433
federal minimum wage to
ten dollars

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:13.000
and ten cents an hour.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.767
This wouldn't just raise
wages for minimum wage

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:18.533
workers - its effects
would lift wages for

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:20.467
nearly 28 million
Americans

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:22.400
across this country.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.533
It will give businesses
more customers with more

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:28.100
money to spend, and grow
the economy for everybody.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.800
So call up your Member of
Congress

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.066
and let them know it's time for "ten-ten."

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:35.000
It's time to give
America a raise.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.967
A true opportunity agenda
is one that works

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:39.033
for working women.

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:42.367
Because when women
succeed, America succeeds.

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:45.033
We do better when everyone
participates, and when

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:46.433
everyone who works hard

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:48.800
has the chance to get ahead.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.433
That's what opportunity
means -

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:53.300
and it's why I'll keep fighting
to restore it.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.033
Thanks, everybody, and
have a great weekend.
