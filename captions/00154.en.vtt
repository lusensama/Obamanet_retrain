00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.900
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.600
Our top priority as a country
right now should be doing

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.133
everything we can to grow
our economy and create good,

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.900
middle class jobs.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.867
And yet, less than
one week from now,

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:19.934
Congress is poised to allow
a series of arbitrary,

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:23.834
automatic budget cuts that
will do the exact opposite.

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:25.567
They'll slow our economy.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:27.867
They'll eliminate good jobs.

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:30.033
They'll leave many families who
are already stretched to the

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:33.567
limit scrambling to
figure out what to do.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:37.100
But here's the thing: these
cuts don't have to happen.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.100
Congress can turn them
off anytime with just a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.867
little compromise.

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:45.467
They can pass a balanced
plan for deficit reduction.

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:47.667
They can cut spending
in a smart way,

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:50.567
and close wasteful tax
loopholes for the well-off

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:52.633
and well-connected.

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:54.900
Unfortunately, it appears that
Republicans in Congress have

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.467
decided that instead
of compromising --

00:00:57.467 --> 00:01:00.900
instead of asking anything of
the wealthiest Americans --

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.200
they'd rather let these
cuts fall squarely on the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.467
middle class.

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:07.000
And here's what
that choice means:

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.767
Once these cuts take effect,
thousands of teachers and

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:13.100
educators will be laid off, and
tens of thousands of parents

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.567
will have to scramble to find
child care for their kids.

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:19.233
Air traffic controllers and
airport security will see

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:22.533
cutbacks, causing delays
across the country.

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.367
Even President Bush's director
of the National Institutes of

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:29.367
Health says these cuts will
set back medical science for

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:31.200
a generation.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.600
Already, the threat of these
cuts has forced the Navy to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.433
delay the deployment of an
aircraft carrier to the Persian

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:39.667
Gulf -- affecting our ability
to respond to threats in an

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:41.767
unstable part of the world.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:44.967
And just this week, the Pentagon
announced that if these cuts go

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:48.934
through, almost 800,000
defense employees --

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:53.033
the equivalent of every person
in Miami and Cleveland combined

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:56.400
-- will be forced to
take unpaid leave.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.433
That's what this choice means.

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:01.300
Are Republicans in Congress
really willing to let these cuts

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.467
fall on our kids' schools and
mental health care just to

00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:07.834
protect tax loopholes
for corporate jet owners?

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:10.800
Are they really willing to slash
military health care and the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.867
border patrol just because they
refuse to eliminate tax breaks

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:15.934
for big oil companies?

00:02:15.934 --> 00:02:18.700
Are they seriously prepared to
inflict more pain on the middle

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.066
class because they refuse to ask
anything more of those at the

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:23.867
very top?

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:25.867
These are the questions
Republicans in Congress need to

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:27.000
ask themselves.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.500
And I'm hopeful they'll
change their minds.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.934
Because the American people have
worked too hard for too long to

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:36.233
see everything they've built
undone by partisan recklessness

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:37.834
in Washington.

00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:40.000
Instead of these reckless,
unbalanced cuts,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.233
I believe we should work
together to build on the more

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:45.033
than $2.5 trillion in
deficit reduction we've

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:46.700
already achieved.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.767
We should do it in
a balanced way --

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:51.667
with smart spending
cuts, entitlement reform,

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:53.400
and tax reform.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.934
That's my plan.

00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:57.633
It's got tough
cuts, tough reforms,

00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:00.767
and asks more of the
wealthiest Americans.

00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:03.734
It's on the White House
website for everyone to see.

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:07.500
And it requires Democrats and
Republicans to meet half way to

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.367
resolve the problem.

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:11.567
That's what the
American people expect.

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:13.367
And that's what you deserve.

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:16.200
We just need Republicans in
Washington to come around.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.800
Because we need their help to
finish the job of reducing our

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.934
deficit in a smart way that
doesn't hurt our economy or

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.266
our people.

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:25.800
After all, as we
learned in the 1990s,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.900
nothing shrinks the deficit
faster than a growing economy

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.300
that creates good,
middle-class jobs.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.433
That has to be
our driving focus.

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:35.467
That has to be our North Star.

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:37.834
Making America a
magnet for good jobs.

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:39.700
Equipping our people with
the skills required to

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.200
fill those jobs.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.600
Making sure your hard work
leads to a decent living.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.333
That's what this city should
be focused on like a laser.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:50.834
And I'm going to keep pushing
folks here to remember that.

00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:51.834
Thanks so much.
