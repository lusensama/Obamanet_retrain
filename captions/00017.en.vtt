00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.712
The President: Happy
New Year, everybody.

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:15.582
I am fired up for the year
that stretches out before us.

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.650
That's because of what we've
accomplished together

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.919
over the past seven.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.122
Seven years ago, our
businesses were losing

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.591
800,000 jobs a month.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:28.128
They've now created jobs
for 69 straight months,

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:30.964
driving the unemployment
rate from a high of 10%

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.032
down to 5%.

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:35.068
Seven years ago, too many
Americans went

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.669
without health insurance.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:39.806
We've now covered more
than 17 million people,

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:43.309
dropping the rate of the
uninsured below 10% for the

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.645
very first time.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:49.315
Seven years ago, we were
addicted to foreign oil.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.885
Now our oil imports
have plummeted,

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.887
our clean energy
industry is booming,

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.256
and America is a global
leader in the fight against

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:58.158
climate change.

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:00.693
Seven years ago, there were
only two states in America

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:02.295
with marriage equality.

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:04.697
And now there are 50.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.699
All of this progress
is because of you.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.701
And we've got so
much more to do.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.371
So my New Year's resolution
is to move forward on our

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.406
unfinished business
as much as I can.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:17.343
And I'll be more frequently
asking for your help.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:20.180
That's what this American
project is all about.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.515
That's especially true for
one piece of unfinished

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:26.419
business, that's our
epidemic of gun violence.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:28.655
Last month, we remembered
the third anniversary

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.156
of Newtown.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:32.859
This Friday, I'll be
thinking about my friend

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.795
Gabby Giffords, five years
into her recovery from the

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:37.530
shooting in Tucson.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.733
And all across America,
survivors of gun violence

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.403
and those who lost
a child, a parent,

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:47.106
a spouse to gun violence are
forced to mark such awful

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:50.743
anniversaries
every single day.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:53.413
And yet Congress still
hasn't done anything to

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.415
prevent what happened to
them from happening

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.417
to other families.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:58.818
Three years ago,
a bipartisan,

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:01.387
commonsense bill would have
required background checks

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:04.691
for virtually everyone
who buys a gun.

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:08.094
Keep in mind, this policy
was supported by some 90% of

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:09.829
the American people.

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:14.100
It was supported by a
majority of NRA households.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.402
But the gun lobby
mobilized against it.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.671
And the Senate blocked it.

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:21.007
Since then, tens of
thousands of our fellow

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.409
Americans have been mowed
down by gun violence.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.578
Tens of thousands.

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:28.147
Each time, we're told that
commonsense reforms like

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:30.583
background checks might
not have stopped the last

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.585
massacre, or the
one before that,

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:35.021
so we shouldn't do anything.

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:37.757
We know that we can't stop
every act of violence.

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:40.493
But what if we tried
to stop even one?

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:42.762
What if Congress did
something - anything - to

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:45.932
protect our kids
from gun violence?

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.268
A few months ago, I directed
my team at the White House

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:50.837
to look into any new actions
I can take to help

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.639
reduce gun violence.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.908
And on Monday, I'll meet
with our Attorney General,

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:57.810
Loretta Lynch, to
discuss our options.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.014
Because I get too many
letters from parents,

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:05.618
and teachers, and kids, to
sit around and do nothing.

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:07.620
I get letters from
responsible gun owners who

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.024
grieve with us every time
these tragedies happen;

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.192
who share my belief that the
Second Amendment guarantees

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:15.595
a right to bear arms; and
who share my belief we can

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:18.698
protect that right while
keeping an irresponsible,

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.067
dangerous few from
inflicting harm

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:23.436
on a massive scale.

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:26.005
So, I know there are a bunch
of us who care about this.

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:29.976
If you are one of
them, I need your help.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.979
Change is always going
to take all of us.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.415
The gun lobby is loud,
and well-organized in its

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:40.286
defense of effortlessly
available guns for anyone.

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:41.821
The rest of us are going
to have to be just as

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:44.157
passionate and
well-organized in our

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.659
defense of our kids.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.328
That's the work
of citizenship.

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:51.531
To stand up and fight for
the change that we seek.

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:54.467
I hope you'll join me in
making America safer for all

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.436
of our children.

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.504
Thanks everybody.
