00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:06.867
The President:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:09.333
I'm speaking to you this
week from the Boeing Plant in

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.133
Everett, Washington.

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.667
Boeing has been in this
community for half a century.

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:16.734
But it's what they're doing
here today that has folks really

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:20.367
excited; because at this plant
they're building the plane of

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:23.000
the future -- the Dreamliner.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.233
It's an impressive sight.

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:28.533
And, to be honest, part of why
I came was to see it up close.

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.667
But I also came because this is
a great example of how we can

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:35.467
bring jobs and manufacturing
back to America.

00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:37.266
You see, the last few
decades haven't been easy for

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.367
manufacturing in this country.

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:42.166
New technology has made
businesses more efficient and

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.033
productive -- and that's good
-- but it's also made a lot of

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:46.767
jobs obsolete.

00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:49.367
The result has been painful
for a lot of families

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:51.200
and a lot of communities.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.000
Factories where people thought
they'd retire have left town.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.834
Jobs that provided a
decent living have been

00:00:56.834 --> 00:00:58.567
shipped overseas.

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:00.867
And the hard truth is that
a lot of those jobs aren't

00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:02.367
coming back.

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:06.100
But that doesn't mean we have
to settle for a lesser future.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.867
I don't accept that idea.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.266
In America, there's always
something we can do to create

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.600
new jobs and new manufacturing
and new security for

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.133
the middle-class.

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:18.567
In America, we don't
give up -- we get up.

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:20.934
Right now, that's
exactly what we're doing.

00:01:20.934 --> 00:01:24.834
Over the past 23 months,
businesses have created 3.7

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:26.467
million new jobs.

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:30.400
And manufacturers are hiring for
the first time since the 1990s.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.834
It's now getting more expensive
to do business in places

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:34.367
like China.

00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:37.033
Meanwhile, America is
more productive than ever.

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:40.033
And companies like Boeing are
realizing that even when we

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.700
can't make things
cheaper than China,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.600
we can make things better.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.200
That's how we're going
to compete globally.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.333
For Boeing, business
right now is booming.

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:53.900
Last year, orders for commercial
aircraft rose by more than 50%.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.100
To meet that rising demand,
they've put thousands of folks

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.700
to work all over the country.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.767
We want to see more of this.

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:05.133
We need to make it as easy as we
can for our companies to create

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:08.667
more jobs in America,
not overseas.

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:11.166
And that starts
with our tax code.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:14.667
No company should get a tax
break for outsourcing jobs.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.567
Instead, tax breaks should go
to manufacturers who set up shop

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:19.233
here at home.

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:21.667
Bigger tax breaks should go
to high-tech manufacturers who

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:23.600
create the jobs of the future.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.333
And if you relocate a company
in a struggling community,

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.900
you should get help
financing that new plant,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.100
that new equipment, or
training for new workers.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.133
It's time to stop rewarding
businesses that ship jobs

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:38.767
overseas, and start rewarding
businesses that create jobs here

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:39.767
in America.

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:44.066
And Congress should send me that
kind of tax reform right away.

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.867
Another thing we're doing is
to make it easier for companies

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:49.934
like Boeing to sell their
products all over the world,

00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:52.834
because more exports
mean more jobs.

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:55.633
Two years ago, I set a goal
of doubling U.S. exports

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.100
over five years.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.734
And we're on track
to meet that goal --

00:02:58.734 --> 00:03:00.667
ahead of schedule.

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:03.967
We have a big opportunity right
now to build not only an economy

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:07.367
that will help us succeed today,
but an economy that will help

00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:10.433
our kids and their
kids succeed tomorrow.

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:12.100
We know what we need to do.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.400
We need to strengthen
American manufacturing.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.567
We need to invest in
American-made energy and new

00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:18.667
skills for American workers.

00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:21.700
And above all, we need to renew
the values that have always made

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.233
this country great: Hard work.

00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:25.567
Fair play.

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:27.800
Shared responsibility.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.500
We can do this.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.000
Just ask the folks
here in Everett.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.400
Right here, a few years ago, the
first Dreamliner took off on its

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.066
maiden trip.

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:39.900
Thousands of employees
came to watch.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.433
One was an executive
office administrator named

00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:43.500
Sharon O'Hara.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.400
And as Sharon saw that
first plane take flight --

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.166
a result of so much hard
work -- she got goose bumps.

00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:57.500
In her words, she said, "We
said we would do it and we did."

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.133
That's the story of America.

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:02.000
We said we'd do it, and we did.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.500
That's the can-do spirit
that makes us who we are.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.934
We've seen challenging
times before.

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:09.567
But we always emerge
from them stronger.

00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:12.333
And that's what we're
going to do again today.

00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:14.433
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
