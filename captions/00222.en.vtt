00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:07.900
The President:
Over the last few weeks, I've
been making the case that we

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.633
need to act now on
the American Jobs Act,

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:13.433
so we can put folks back to work
and start building an economy

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:16.000
that lasts into the future.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.967
Education is an essential
part of this economic agenda.

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:23.200
It is an undeniable fact that
countries who out-educate us

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.200
today will out-compete
us tomorrow.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.700
Businesses will hire wherever
the highly-skilled and

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.066
highly-trained
workers are located.

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.934
But today, our students are
sliding against their peers

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.633
around the globe.

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:38.500
Today, our kids trail too many
other countries in math and

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.800
science and reading.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.500
As many as a quarter of
our students aren't even

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.100
finishing high school.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.233
And we've fallen to 16th in the
proportion of our young people

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:51.133
with a college degree, even
though we know that 60% of new

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.667
jobs in the coming decade
will require more than a high

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:55.266
school diploma.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.533
What this means is that if
we're serious about building an

00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:01.233
economy that lasts -- an economy
in which hard work pays off with

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:04.333
the opportunity for solid
middle class jobs --

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.834
we had better be
serious about education.

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:10.433
We have to pick up our game
and raise our standards.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:12.600
As a nation, we have an
obligation to make sure that all

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.200
children have the resources
they need to learn --

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.433
quality schools, good teachers,
the latest textbooks and the

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:20.066
right technology.

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.700
That's why the jobs bill I sent
to Congress would put tens of

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.266
thousands of teachers back
to work across the country,

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:29.467
and modernize at
least 35,000 schools.

00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:32.767
That's why Congress should
pass that bill right now.

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:35.667
But money alone won't solve
our education problems.

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:37.667
We also need reform.

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:40.066
We need to make sure that every
classroom is a place of high

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.834
expectations and
high performance.

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:45.600
That's been our vision
since taking office.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.300
And that's why instead of just
pouring money into the system

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300
that wasn't working, we launched
a competition called Race

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.934
to the Top.

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:55.633
To all 50 states, we said,
"If you show us the most

00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:58.200
innovative plans to improve
teacher quality and student

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.934
achievement, we'll
show you the money."

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:04.433
For less than 1% of what we
spend on education each year,

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:07.166
Race to the Top has led states
across the country to raise

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:09.867
their standards for
teaching and learning.

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:12.367
These standards were
developed, not by Washington,

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:14.967
but by Republican and
Democratic governors throughout

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:16.367
the country.

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:19.200
And since then, we have seen
what's possible when reform

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.100
isn't just a top-down mandate,
but the work of local teachers

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.066
and principals; school
boards and communities.

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:29.667
That's why in my State of
the Union address this year,

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:33.533
I said to Congress, you need to
reform the No Child Left Behind

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:35.934
law based on the same
principles that have guided

00:02:35.934 --> 00:02:38.367
Race to the Top.

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:41.800
While the goals behind No Child
Left Behind were admirable,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.500
experience has taught us that
the law has some serious flaws

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.500
that are hurting our children
instead of helping them.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.200
Teachers are being forced
to teach to the test,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.467
while subjects like history and
science are being squeezed out.

00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:55.800
And in order to avoid having
their schools labeled as

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.300
failures, some states lowered
their standards in a race to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.633
the bottom.

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:03.000
These problems have been obvious
to parents and educators all

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.533
over this country for years.

00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:08.734
But for years, Congress
has failed to fix them.

00:03:08.734 --> 00:03:11.000
So now, I will.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.867
Our kids only get one shot
at a decent education.

00:03:13.867 --> 00:03:16.233
And they can't afford
to wait any longer.

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:18.934
So yesterday, I announced that
we'll be giving states more

00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:21.100
flexibility to meet high
standards for teaching

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.500
and learning.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.533
It's time for us to let states
and schools and teachers come up

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:28.700
with innovative ways to give our
children the skills they need to

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.467
compete for the
jobs of the future.

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:33.433
This will make a huge difference
in the lives of students all

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:35.433
across the country.

00:03:35.433 --> 00:03:37.967
For example, yesterday,
I was with Ricci Hall,

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:41.233
the principal of a school in
Worcester, Massachusetts.

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:43.700
Every single student who
graduated from Ricci's school in

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.467
the last three years
went on to college.

00:03:46.467 --> 00:03:48.433
But because they didn't meet
the standards of No Child Left

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:53.300
Behind, Ricci's school was
labeled as failing last year.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.467
That will change because
of what we did yesterday.

00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:58.533
From now on, we'll be able
to encourage the progress at

00:03:58.533 --> 00:04:00.333
schools like Ricci's.

00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:02.066
From now on, people
like John Becker,

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:03.800
who teaches at one of the
highest-performing middle

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.934
schools in D.C., will be able
to focus on teaching his 4th

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:10.333
graders math in ways that
improves their performance

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.734
instead of just
teaching to a test.

00:04:12.734 --> 00:04:16.333
Superintendents like Dave Estrop
from Ohio will be able to focus

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:19.033
on improving teaching and
learning in his district instead

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:21.567
of spending all his time on
bureaucratic mandates from

00:04:21.567 --> 00:04:24.900
Washington that
don't get results.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.734
This isn't just the right
thing to do for our kids --

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:31.300
it's the right thing to do for
our country, and our future.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.166
It's time to put our
teachers back on the job.

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:37.066
It's time to rebuild and
modernize our schools.

00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:40.133
And it's time to raise our
standards, up our game,

00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:43.533
and do everything it takes to
prepare our children to succeed

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.734
in the global economy.

00:04:45.734 --> 00:04:49.433
Now is the time to once again
make our education system the

00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:51.633
envy of the world.

00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:52.834
Thanks for listening.
