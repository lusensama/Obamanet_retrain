00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:10.266
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:13.300
In my State of the Union
Address, I talked about pizza.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.633
More specifically, I
talked about a pizza chain

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:19.633
in Minneapolis - Punch Pizza -
whose owner, John Soranno,

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:22.633
made the business decision to
give his employees a raise

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:23.633
to ten bucks an hour.

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:27.000
A couple weeks ago, I got a
letter from a small business

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.333
owner who watched that night.

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:33.767
Yasmin Ibrahim is an immigrant
who owns her own restaurant -

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:37.300
Desi Shack - and plans to
open another this summer.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.967
Here's what she wrote.

00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:42.000
"I was moved by John
Soranno's story.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.934
It got me thinking about my
... full-time employees and

00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:50.133
their ability to survive on
$8 an hour in New York City."

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:54.533
So a few weeks ago, Yasmin put
in place a plan to lift wages

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:58.100
for her employees at both her
restaurants to at least $10

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.934
an hour by the end of this year.

00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:04.467
But here's the thing - Yasmin
isn't just raising her

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:07.333
employees' wages because
it's the right thing to do.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.467
She's doing it for the same
reason John Soranno did.

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:13.266
It makes good business sense.

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:17.400
Yasmin wrote, "It will allow us
to attract and retain better

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.734
talent - improving
customer experience,

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:23.934
reducing employee churn
and training costs.

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:27.233
We believe doing so makes good
business sense while at the same

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:30.867
time having a positive
impact on the community."

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:32.333
Yasmin's right.

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:35.233
That's why, two months ago,
I issued an Executive Order

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:39.500
requiring workers on new federal
contracts to be paid a fair wage

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.600
of at least ten dollars
and ten cents an hour.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.600
But in order to make a
difference for every American,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.233
Congress needs to do something.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:49.567
And America knows it.

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:52.033
Right now, there's a bill that
would boost America's minimum

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:55.133
wage to ten dollars
and ten cents an hour.

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:58.233
That would lift wages for
nearly 28 million Americans

00:01:58.233 --> 00:01:59.700
across the country.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.467
28 million.

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:04.400
And we're not just talking about
young people on their first job.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.834
The average minimum wage
worker is 35 years old.

00:02:08.834 --> 00:02:13.000
They work hard, often in
physically demanding jobs.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.033
And while not all of us always
see eye to eye politically,

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:19.266
one thing we overwhelmingly
agree on is that nobody who

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:23.834
works full-time should ever
have to live in poverty.

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:27.200
That's why nearly three in
four Americans support raising

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.266
the minimum wage.

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:32.633
The problem is, Republicans in
Congress don't support raising

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:34.100
the minimum wage.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.233
Some even want to get
rid of it entirely.

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:39.867
In Oklahoma, for example, the
Republican governor just signed

00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:43.166
a law prohibiting cities
from establishing their

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:45.500
own minimum wage.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.900
That's why this fight
is so important.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.200
That's why people like John
and Yasmin are giving their

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.667
workers a raise.

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:53.433
That's why several
states, counties,

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:56.700
and cities are going around
Congress to raise their

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.433
workers' wages.

00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:00.834
That's why I'll
keep up this fight.

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:04.300
Because we know that our economy
works best when it works for

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.834
all of us - not just
a fortunate few.

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:10.700
We believe we do better when
everyone who works hard has

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.567
a chance to get ahead.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:15.133
That's what opportunity
is all about.

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:18.433
And if you agree with us,
we could use your help.

00:03:18.433 --> 00:03:22.433
Republicans have voted more than
50 times to undermine or repeal

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:24.300
health care for
millions of Americans.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.800
They should vote at least once
to raise the minimum wage for

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.633
millions of working families.

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:33.400
If a Republican in
Congress represents you,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.600
tell him or her it's time to
give the politics a rest for

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.300
a while and do something to
help working Americans.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.200
It's time for "ten-ten."

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.934
It's time to give
America a raise.

00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:46.533
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
