00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.233
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:10.233
Four years ago this month, a
crisis that started out on Wall

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:13.166
Street almost brought
down our entire economy.

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.500
The nation's biggest banks
were days away from failing.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.900
The stock market -- and millions
of American retirement accounts

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.533
-- were in free-fall.

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.934
Credit froze.

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:24.100
Lending stopped.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.033
And businesses large and small
didn't even know if they'd be

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.800
able to make payroll.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.834
It was a moment the likes
of which few Americans had

00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:33.000
seen before.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.500
Today, we know the biggest cause
of that crisis was reckless

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.734
behavior in the housing market.

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:41.967
Millions of Americans who did
the right and responsible thing

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:44.200
-- who shopped for a home,
secured a mortgage they could

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.166
afford, and made their
payments on time --

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:51.033
were badly hurt by the
irresponsible actions of others.

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:53.400
By lenders who sold loans to
families who couldn't afford

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.834
them -- and buyers who knew
they couldn't afford them.

00:00:56.834 --> 00:01:00.333
By speculators who were looking
just to make a quick buck.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.734
And by banks that packaged and
sold those risky mortgages for

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:05.533
phony profits.

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.400
When the party stopped, and
the housing bubble burst,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.934
it pushed our entire economy
into a historic recession --

00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:14.934
and left middle-class
families holding the bag.

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:17.900
Four years later, the
housing market is healing.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.066
Home sales and
construction are up.

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.100
Prices are beginning to rise.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.066
And more than a million families
who began this year owing more

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.333
on their mortgages than
their homes are worth,

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.700
are now back above water.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.800
So we're moving in
the right direction.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.500
But we're not there yet.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.667
There are still millions of
Americans who are struggling

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:39.867
with their mortgages, even at a
time of historically low rates.

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:42.567
Now, I know there are some who
think that the only option for

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:45.133
homeowners is to just stand by
and hope that the market has

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.433
hit bottom.

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:48.033
I don't agree with that.

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:50.567
That's why my Administration
teamed up with state attorneys

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:53.467
general to investigate the
terrible way many homeowners

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:56.300
were treated, and secured a
settlement from the nation's

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.100
biggest banks -- banks that were
bailed out with taxpayer dollars

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.767
-- to help families
stay in their homes.

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:05.767
And that's why we announced
new steps to help responsible

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:08.400
homeowners refinance
their mortgages.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.333
Already, hundreds of thousands
of Americans who were stuck in

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:14.266
high-interest rate loans have
been able to take advantage of

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:18.066
lower rates and save thousands
of dollars every year.

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:19.834
That's not only good
for those families;

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:21.834
it's also good for our economy.

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:23.734
When folks are spending
less on mortgage payments,

00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:26.166
they're spending more
at local businesses.

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.367
And when those businesses
have more customers,

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:30.567
they start hiring more workers.

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:33.533
But we can do even more
if Congress is willing to

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:35.033
do their part.

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:37.700
Back in February, I sent
Congress a plan to give every

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.533
responsible homeowner the chance
to save about $3,000 a year on

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:44.767
their mortgages by
refinancing at lower rates.

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:46.834
It's a plan that has the
support of independent,

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:49.033
nonpartisan economists
and leaders across the

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:50.533
housing industry.

00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:52.633
But Republicans in Congress
worked to keep it from even

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:54.133
getting to a vote.

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:55.700
And here we are --
seven months later --

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.100
still waiting on
Congress to act.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.700
This makes no sense.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.066
Last week, mortgage rates
were at historic lows.

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:05.600
But instead of helping more and
more hardworking families take

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.333
advantage of those rates,
Congress was away on break.

00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:11.834
Instead of worrying about you,
they'd already gone home to

00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:14.100
worry about their campaigns.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.734
The truth is, it's going to take
a while for our housing market

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:18.300
to fully recover.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.233
But it's going to take
a lot more time --

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:23.500
and cause a lot more hurt --
if Congress keeps standing

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.700
in the way.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.700
If you agree with me, I hope
you'll make your voices heard.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.233
Call your Representative.

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:30.633
Send them an email.

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:33.266
Show up at their town hall and
tell them that when Congress

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:37.433
comes back to Washington, they
better come back ready to work.

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:39.100
All of you are doing
everything you can to meet

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.600
your responsibilities.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.834
I think it's time
Congress did the same.

00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:44.467
Thanks and have a great weekend.
