00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.200
The President:
Today I'd like to talk with you
about a subject that I know is

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.200
on everybody's mind, and that's
the state of our economy.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.133
Yesterday, we received a report
on our Gross Domestic Product.

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:23.467
That's a measure of our
overall economic performance.

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:26.800
The report showed that in the
first few months of this year,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.333
the recession we faced when I
took office was even deeper than

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.400
anyone thought at the time.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.467
It told us how close
we were to the edge.

00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:37.734
But it also revealed that
in the last few months,

00:00:37.734 --> 00:00:41.333
the economy has done measurably
better than expected.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.467
And many economists suggest
that part of this progress is

00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:47.734
directly attributable
to the Recovery Act.

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:50.667
This and the other difficult but
important steps that we've taken

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:55.300
over the last six months have helped put the brakes on this recession.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.767
We took unprecedented action to
stem the spread of foreclosures

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:01.333
by helping responsible
homeowners stay in their homes

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.033
and pay their mortgages.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:05.633
We helped revive the credit
markets and open up loans for

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:08.000
families and small businesses.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.066
And we enacted a Recovery Act
that puts tax cuts directly into

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.900
the pockets of middle-class
families and small businesses;

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.934
extended unemployment insurance
and health insurance for folks

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:21.066
who have lost their jobs; provided relief to struggling

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:24.734
states to prevent layoffs of teachers and police officers;

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:27.400
and made investments that are
putting people back to work

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.033
rebuilding and renovating roads,
bridges, schools, and hospitals.

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:36.166
Now, I realize that none of this
is much comfort for Americans

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:39.533
who are still out of work or
struggling to make ends meet.

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.667
And when we receive our
monthly job report next week,

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:45.533
it's likely to show that we are
continuing to lose far too many

00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.567
jobs in this country.

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:50.767
As far as I'm concerned, we will
not have a recovery as long as

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:52.567
we keep losing jobs.

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:57.700
And I won't rest until every
American who wants a job can find one.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.500
But history shows that you need
to have economic growth before

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.333
you have job growth.

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:05.133
And the report yesterday on our
economy is an important sign

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:07.100
that we're headed in
the right direction.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.900
Business investment, which had
been plummeting in the past few

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.900
months, is showing
signs of stabilizing.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.433
This means that eventually,
businesses will start growing

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:17.033
and hiring again.

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:19.700
And that's when it will really
feel like a recovery to the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.367
American people.

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:22.867
This won't happen overnight.

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:26.033
As I've said before, it will
take many more months to fully

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:28.133
dig ourselves out
of a recession --

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:31.367
a recession that we've now
learned was even deeper than

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:32.767
anyone thought.

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:34.633
But I'll continue
to work every day,

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:38.633
and take every step necessary,
to make sure that happens.

00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:41.133
I also want to make sure that we
don't return to an economy where

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:44.166
our growth is based on inflated
profits and maxed-out credit

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:47.500
cards -- because that
doesn't create a lot of jobs.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.433
Even as we rescue this economy,
we must work to rebuild it

00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:53.100
stronger than before.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.700
We've got to build a new
foundation strong enough to

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.533
withstand future economic storms
and support lasting prosperity.

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:03.066
Next week, I'll be talking about
that new foundation when I head

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:07.300
to Elkhart county in Indiana -- a city hit hard not only by the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.734
economic crisis of recent months but by the broader economic

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:12.800
changes of recent decades.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.834
For communities like
Elkhart to thrive,

00:03:14.834 --> 00:03:18.400
we need to recapture the spirit
of innovation that has always

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.400
moved America forward.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.934
That means once again
having the best-educated,

00:03:22.934 --> 00:03:25.767
highest skilled
workforce in the world.

00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:28.000
That means a health care system
that makes it possible for

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.433
entrepreneurs to innovate and
businesses to compete without

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:34.800
being saddled with
skyrocketing insurance costs.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.500
That means leading the world
in building a new clean energy

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.467
economy with the potential to
unleash a wave of innovation --

00:03:41.467 --> 00:03:45.367
and economic growth -- while ending our dependence on foreign oil.

00:03:45.367 --> 00:03:48.433
And that means investing in the
research and development that

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:50.667
will produce the
technologies of the future --

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:55.033
which in turn will help create
the industries and jobs of the future.

00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:57.800
Innovation has been essential to
our prosperity in the past --

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.066
and it will be essential to
our prosperity in the future.

00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:03.734
But it's only by building a new
foundation that we will once

00:04:03.734 --> 00:04:06.934
again harness that incredible
generative capacity of the

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:08.867
American people.

00:04:08.867 --> 00:04:12.300
All it takes are the policies
to tap that potential --

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.000
to ignite that spark of
creativity and ingenuity --

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
which has always been at the
heart of who we are and how we succeed.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.266
At a time when folks are
experiencing real hardship,

00:04:22.266 --> 00:04:24.900
after years in which we've
seen so many fail to take

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.734
responsibility for our
collective future,

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:31.467
it's important to keep our
eyes fixed on that horizon.

00:04:31.467 --> 00:04:35.133
Every day, I hear from Americans
who are feeling firsthand the

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:37.533
pain of this recession; these
are folks who share their

00:04:37.533 --> 00:04:41.000
stories with me in letters
and at town hall meetings;

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.600
folks who remain in my mind and
on my agenda each and every day.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.667
I know that there are countless
families and businesses

00:04:48.667 --> 00:04:52.200
struggling to just hang on
until this storm passes.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.066
But I also know that if we do
the things we know we must,

00:04:56.066 --> 00:04:58.133
this storm will pass.

00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:00.600
And it will yield
a brighter day.
