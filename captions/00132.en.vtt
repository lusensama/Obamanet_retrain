00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.533
The President:
For the past few weeks, 
I've been visiting folks across

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.233
America to talk about what
we need to do as a country

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:13.433
to secure a better bargain
for the middle class.

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:16.000
I've been laying out my ideas
for how we can build on the

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.667
cornerstones of what it means
to be middle class in America.

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:20.867
A good job.

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:22.367
A good education.

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:24.934
Affordable health care
when you get sick.

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:27.567
A secure retirement
even if you're not rich.

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:30.500
And the chance to
own your own home.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.066
This week, I went to
Arizona and California,

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:36.266
two of the states hit hardest
when the housing bubble burst,

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.300
triggering the recession.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.433
All across the country, millions
of responsible Americans were

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:44.567
hurt badly by the reckless
actions of others.

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:46.133
Home values plummeted.

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.300
Construction workers
were laid off.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.800
And many families
lost their homes.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.066
Over the past four years, we've
worked to help millions

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.900
of responsible homeowners
get back on their feet.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.967
And while we're not
where we need to be yet,

00:00:57.967 --> 00:01:00.433
our housing market
is beginning to heal.

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:02.734
Home prices and
sales are rising.

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:03.967
Construction is up.

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:05.867
Foreclosures are down.

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:08.000
Millions of families have come
up for air because they're

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.400
no longer underwater
on their mortgages.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.900
Now we have to build
on this progress.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.667
Congress should give every
American the chance to refinance

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.100
at today's low rates.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.967
We should help more qualified
families get a mortgage

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:23.166
and buy their first home.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.734
We should get construction
workers back on the job

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:29.066
rebuilding communities
hit hardest by the crisis.

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.700
And we should make sure that
folks who don't want to buy

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.533
a home have decent,
affordable places to rent.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.100
As home prices rise, we
have to turn the page on the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.900
bubble-and-bust mentality
that created this mess,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.133
and build a housing system
that's rock-solid and rewards

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:48.467
responsibility for
generations to come.

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:50.834
That means winding down the
companies known as Fannie Mae

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:54.300
and Freddie Mac, making sure
private capital plays a bigger

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.467
role in the mortgage market,
and ending the era of expecting

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:01.200
a bailout after your pursuit of
profit puts the whole

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.266
country at risk.

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:05.834
We need to preserve access to
safe and simple mortgages

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.500
like the 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgage.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.033
We need to keep laying down
rules of the road that protect

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:13.600
homeowners when they're making
the biggest purchase

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.266
of their lives.

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:18.567
And finally, Congress needs
to confirm Mel Watt to be our

00:02:18.567 --> 00:02:22.066
nation's top housing regulator,
so that he can protect consumers

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:26.000
and help responsible
lenders provide credit.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.567
No program or policy will
solve all the problems

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:31.066
in a multi-trillion dollar
housing market,

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:34.266
and it will take time
to fully recover.

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:37.734
But if we work together, we can
make a home a source of pride

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:40.166
and middle-class security again.

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:43.166
And if Washington is willing to
set aside politics and focus on

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:46.834
what really matters, we can
rebuild an economy where if you

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:49.266
work hard, you can get ahead.

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:51.467
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
