00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:12.033
The President:
This weekend marks the fourth anniversary of Hurricane

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.867
Katrina's devastation
of the Gulf Coast.

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:16.967
As we remember
all that was lost,

00:00:16.967 --> 00:00:19.967
we must take stock of the
work being done on recovery,

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:22.300
while preparing for
future disasters.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.033
That's what I want to
speak with you about today.

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:27.734
None of us can forget how we
felt when those winds battered

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:30.934
the shore, the
floodwaters began to rise,

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:34.767
and Americans were stranded
on rooftops and in stadiums.

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:37.367
Over a thousand people
would lose their lives.

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:39.800
Over a million people
were displaced.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.066
Whole neighborhoods of a great
American city were left in ruins.

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:48.033
Communities across the Gulf
Coast were forever changed.

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:50.567
And many Americans questioned
whether government could fulfill

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:53.467
its responsibilities
to respond in a crisis,

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:58.233
or contribute to a recovery that
covered parts of four states.

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:01.600
Since taking office in January,
my Administration has focused on

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.433
helping citizens finish the work
of rebuilding their lives and

00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:08.667
communities, while taking steps
to prevent similar catastrophes

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.100
going forward.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.600
Our approach is simple:
government must keep its

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.767
responsibility to the people,
so that Americans have the

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:19.233
opportunity to take responsibility for their own future.

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:21.033
That's the work
that we're doing.

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:24.066
To date, eleven members of my
Cabinet have visited the Gulf

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:28.033
Coast, and I'm looking forward
to going to New Orleans later this year.

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:31.000
To complete a complex recovery
that addresses nearly every

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.400
sector of society, we've
prioritized coordination among

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.333
different federal agencies,
and with state and local governments.

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:42.066
No more turf wars -- all of us need to move forward together,

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:45.000
because there's much
more work to be done.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.533
I've also made it clear that we will not tolerate the red tape

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:49.533
that stands in the
way of progress,

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:52.333
or the waste that can
drive up the bill.

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:55.166
Government must be a partner
-- not an opponent --

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:56.734
in getting things done.

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:59.533
That's why we've put in place
innovative review and dispute

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:02.867
resolution programs to
expedite recovery efforts,

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:05.400
and have freed up hundreds of
millions of dollars of federal

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.300
assistance that had
not been distributed.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.567
This is also allowing us to move
forward with stalled projects

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:15.266
across the Gulf Coast -- building and improving schools;

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:17.300
investing in public
health and safety;

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.867
and repairing broken
roads, bridges and homes.

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:23.467
And this effort has been
dramatically amplified by the

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:26.100
Recovery Act, which has
put thousands of Gulf Coast

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.100
residents to work.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.000
As we complete this effort,
we see countless stories of

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.800
citizens holding up
their end of the bargain.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.266
In New Orleans, hundreds of kids
just started the school year at

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:40.867
Langston Hughes elementary, the
first school built from scratch

00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:42.500
since Katrina.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.200
The St. Bernard Project has
drawn together volunteers to

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.033
rebuild hundreds of homes, where
people can live with dignity and security.

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:52.166
To cite just one
hopeful indicator,

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:54.967
New Orleans is the fastest
growing city in America,

00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:58.100
as many who've been
displaced are now coming home.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.166
As we rebuild and recover, we
must also learn the lessons of

00:03:01.166 --> 00:03:04.300
Katrina, so that our nation is
more protected and resilient in

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.100
the face of disaster.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.033
That means continuing to rebuild
hundreds of miles of levees and

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:11.800
floodwalls around New Orleans,
and working to strengthen the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.033
wetlands and barrier islands
that are the Gulf Coast's first

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:16.734
line of defense.

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:19.367
In Washington, that means
a focus on competence and

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:22.467
accountability -- and I'm proud that my FEMA Administrator has

00:03:22.467 --> 00:03:26.367
25 years of experience in disaster management in Florida,

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:29.333
a state that has known
its share of hurricanes.

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:32.066
And across the country, that
means improving coordination

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:35.033
among different agencies,
modernizing our emergency

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:39.433
communications, and helping
families plan for a crisis.

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:43.066
On this anniversary, we are
focused on the threat from hurricanes.

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:46.333
But we must also be prepared
for a broad range of dangers --

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:50.066
from wildfires to earthquakes,
to terrorist attacks and

00:03:50.066 --> 00:03:51.834
pandemic disease.

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:54.233
In particular, my Administration
is working aggressively with

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:56.867
state and local governments -- and with partners around the

00:03:56.867 --> 00:04:02.066
world -- to prepare for the
risk posed by the H1N1 virus.

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:05.500
To learn more about the simple
steps that you can take to keep

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.233
you and your family safe
from all of these dangers,

please visit www.ready.gov.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.533
So on this day, we commemorate a
tragedy that befell our people.

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:20.400
But we also remember that with
every tragedy comes the chance

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.767
of renewal.

00:04:21.767 --> 00:04:24.066
It's a quintessentially
American notion --

00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:26.734
that adversity can
give birth to hope,

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:30.300
and that the lessons of the past
hold the key to a better future.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.200
From the streets of New Orleans
to the Mississippi Coast,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.567
folks are beginning the next
chapter in their American stories.

00:04:37.567 --> 00:04:41.700
And together, we can ensure that
the legacy of a terrible storm

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.233
is a country that is safer and
more prepared for the challenges

00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:46.467
that may come.

00:04:46.467 --> 00:04:47.533
Thank you.
