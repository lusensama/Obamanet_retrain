00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.544
The President: Hello, everybody.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.912
I hope most of you are
gearing up for a long

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:15.382
weekend with family and
friends - maybe some

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:18.985
barbeques, road trips,
or fantasy drafts.

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:21.154
But I wanted to take a
moment to talk to you about

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:24.090
the real meaning of Labor
Day - a day we set aside

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.093
every year to honor the
hardworking men and women

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:30.063
who fought for so many of
the rights that we take for

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.664
granted today.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:37.137
The eight-hour workday,
40-hour workweek, weekends.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.939
Overtime and the
minimum wage.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.941
Safer workplaces.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:45.378
Health insurance, Social
Security, Medicare, and

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.781
retirement plans.

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:51.151
All of those gains were
fought for and won by the

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:54.587
labor movement - folks who
were working not just for a

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.323
bigger paycheck for
themselves, but for more

00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:00.093
security and prosperity for
the folks working next to

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.761
them as well.

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:05.331
That's how we built the
great American middle class.

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:07.667
That's the spirit we've been
working to restore these

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.736
past six and a half years.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.605
On Friday, we found out that
the economy created another

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:15.208
173,000 jobs in August.

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:18.077
Over the past five and a
half years, our businesses

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:21.014
have created 13.1 million
new jobs in total - the

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:24.250
longest streak of job
creation on record.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.754
The unemployment rate
dropped to 5.1%, the lowest

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.457
it's been in seven years.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.659
The American auto industry
is on track to sell more

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.228
cars and trucks this year
than it has in more than

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:36.996
a decade.

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.898
Sixteen million Americans
have gained the security of

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:40.099
health insurance.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.836
Seventeen states and about
30 cities and counties have

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:45.805
raised the minimum wage.

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:48.641
And we've proposed extending
overtime protections to as

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.311
many as five
million Americans.

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:53.847
All of that is progress.

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:57.116
This month, Congress has an
opportunity to continue

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:59.886
that progress.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:01.387
As always, the deadline for
Congress to pass a budget is

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:03.289
the end of September.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.324
Every year.

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:05.358
This is not new.

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:07.894
And if they don't, they'll
shut down the government for

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:10.930
the second time
in two years.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.533
At a time when the global
economy faces headwinds and

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:16.536
America's economy is a
relative bright spot in the

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:19.839
world, a shutdown of our
government would be

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.208
wildly irresponsible.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:25.512
It would be an unforced
error that saps the momentum

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:27.747
we've worked so
hard to build.

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.716
Plain and simple, a
shutdown would hurt

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:31.618
working Americans.

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.153
It doesn't have to happen.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:36.856
If Congress wants to support
working Americans and

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:39.259
strengthen our middle class,
they can pass a budget that

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:44.297
invests in, not makes cuts
to, the middle class.

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:47.000
If they pass a budget with
shortsighted sequester cuts

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.270
that harm our military and
our economy, I'll veto it.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.805
If they make smart
investments in our military

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:55.441
readiness, our
infrastructure, our schools,

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:58.344
public health, and research,
I'll sign that budget - and

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:00.280
they know that.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.515
So let's get it done.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.784
Our economy doesn't need
another round of threats

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:06.252
and brinksmanship.

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:08.821
Nobody gets to play games
with our economy - or the

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:12.659
middle class I grew up in,
and that you grew up in.

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.295
So tell Congress to pass a
budget that reflects the

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.630
values we honor
on Labor Day.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.232
Rewarding hard work.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.234
Giving everybody
a fair shot.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:25.138
And working together to give
all of our kids a better life.

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:26.839
Thanks everybody.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.441
And enjoy your weekend.
