00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.312
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.748
It's now been 45 days since
I nominated

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:17.484
Judge Merrick Garland to the
Supreme Court.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:19.986
Judge Garland is a man of
experience, integrity,

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.422
and unimpeachable
qualifications.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.158
Judge Garland is someone who
Senate Republicans are on

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.627
record saying is "a man of
accomplishment and keen

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:30.897
intellect;" a man who's
"honest and capable; "

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:34.768
a man whose "reputation
is beyond reproach."

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:37.303
Those are all quotes from
Republicans in the Senate.

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.974
But so far, most Senate
Republicans have refused to

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.976
even meet with
Judge Garland.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.678
Which means they've also
refused to do their job and

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.747
hold a hearing on
his nomination,

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:50.417
or an up-or-down vote.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.919
But they've still found time
to head home for recess over

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:53.920
the next week.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:58.525
This is an abdication of the
Senate's responsibility.

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:01.961
Every Supreme Court nominee
since 1875 who hasn't

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:05.532
withdrawn from the process
has received a hearing or a

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:06.966
vote.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:10.103
For over 40 years, there's
been an average of 67 days

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:12.806
between a nomination
and a hearing.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.774
This time should
be no different.

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:17.477
This is not about partisan
politics - it's about

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:20.280
upholding the institutions
that make our democracy

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.281
work.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.583
There's a reason Judge
Garland has earned the

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.286
respect of people from
both political parties.

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.655
As a young lawyer, he left
a lucrative private firm to

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.557
work in public service.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.592
He went to oversee the
federal response to the

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.661
Oklahoma City bombing.

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.797
For the last 19 years, Judge
Garland has served on the

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:41.100
D.C. Circuit Court - often
called "the Second Highest

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.636
Court in the Land" - and
for the past three years,

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:47.106
he's served as that
court's Chief Judge.

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.576
In fact, Judge Merrick
Garland has more federal

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:53.580
judicial experience than any
other Supreme Court nominee

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.415
in history.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.584
With a brilliant
mind, a kind spirit,

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:00.553
and a good heart, he has
dedicated his life to

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:03.623
protecting our rights, and
ensuring that the voices of

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:05.158
everyday Americans
are heard.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.528
So there is absolutely
no reason for Republican

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:11.364
Senators to deny him the
basic courtesy of a hearing

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:14.234
and a vote - the same
courtesy that has been

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.503
extended to others.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.571
This refusal to treat a
Supreme Court nomination

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.573
with the seriousness it
deserves is what makes

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.942
people so cynical
about Washington.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:25.178
That's why poll after
poll shows a majority of

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:27.714
Americans think Senate
Republicans should do their

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:29.883
job; give Judge
Garland a hearing;

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:31.384
and give Judge
Garland a vote.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.621
For all of our
political differences,

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.090
Americans understand that
what unites us is far

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.825
greater than
what divides us.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.694
And in the middle of a
volatile political season,

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:44.864
it is more important than
ever that we fulfill our

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:48.234
duties - in good faith
- as public servants.

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:51.037
The Supreme Court must
remain above partisan

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:52.805
politics.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:55.174
I've done my job - I
nominated someone as

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.544
qualified as
Merrick Garland.

00:02:57.544 --> 00:03:00.947
Now it's time for the
Senate to do their job.

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:02.782
Give Judge
Garland a hearing.

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:05.685
Give Judge Garland
an up-or-down vote.

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:09.222
Treat him - and our
democracy - with the respect

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:10.223
they deserve.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.560
Thanks for listening, and
have a great weekend.
