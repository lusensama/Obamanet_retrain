00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:11.653
The President:
I'm speaking to you today
from Manitowoc, Wisconsin,

00:00:11.653 --> 00:00:15.853
where I'm at an innovative
company called Orion Energy Systems.

00:00:15.853 --> 00:00:19.085
Just a few years ago, this
was an empty warehouse.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.619
A major employer had
shut down this factory,

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.052
moved its operations abroad, and took
a lot of jobs away from this town.

00:00:27.052 --> 00:00:30.786
Today, this is a thriving
enterprise once more.

00:00:30.786 --> 00:00:34.252
You're looking at part of a
factory where 250 workers are

00:00:34.252 --> 00:00:37.185
building advanced
clean energy systems --

00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:40.452
state-of-the-art technologies
that use solar power and energy

00:00:40.452 --> 00:00:44.386
efficiency to save farms and
businesses thousands of dollars

00:00:44.386 --> 00:00:46.719
on their utility bills.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.786
I'm here because this business
and others like it are showing

00:00:49.786 --> 00:00:51.653
us the way forward.

00:00:51.653 --> 00:00:53.853
And in the coming days, I'll
be shining a spotlight on

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:57.519
innovators across America who
are relying on new technologies

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.185
to create new jobs and
opportunities in new industries.

00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:03.486
That's what companies
like Orion are doing.

00:01:03.486 --> 00:01:05.786
And that's how America
will win the future --

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:07.819
by out-innovating,
out-educating,

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:10.185
and out-building
our competitors.

00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:13.853
We'll win the future by being the
best place on Earth to do business.

00:01:13.853 --> 00:01:16.352
That's what we're called
to do at this moment.

00:01:16.352 --> 00:01:20.119
And in my state of the union, I
talked about how we get there.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.886
It starts by making sure that
every single child can get a

00:01:22.886 --> 00:01:25.886
good education and every
American can afford college or

00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:27.819
career training.

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.352
Because that's what will help
light the spark in the minds of

00:01:30.352 --> 00:01:33.319
innovators -- and ensure that
our people have the skills to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.119
work for innovative companies.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.486
We also need to make sure that
America can move goods and

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:41.319
information as fast as
any of our competitors,

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.152
whether on the road or online.

00:01:44.152 --> 00:01:46.919
Because good infrastructure
helps our businesses sell their

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:51.152
products and services
faster and cheaper.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:54.386
We have to reform our government
and cut wasteful spending,

00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:57.386
so that we eliminate what we
don't need to pay for the

00:01:57.386 --> 00:02:02.886
investments we need to grow, like
education and medical research.

00:02:02.886 --> 00:02:06.152
As we can see here in Manitowoc,
we need to ensure that we're

00:02:06.152 --> 00:02:09.352
promoting innovation --
especially in promising areas

00:02:09.352 --> 00:02:11.185
like clean energy.

00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:13.719
This is going to be key to
growing our economy and helping

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.552
businesses create jobs.

00:02:16.552 --> 00:02:19.619
Orion, for example, was able
to open with the help of small

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.452
business loans and incentives
that are creating demand for

00:02:22.452 --> 00:02:26.619
clean energy technologies like
wind power and solar panels.

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:29.152
That's why I've proposed a
bigger tax credit for the

00:02:29.152 --> 00:02:31.419
research that companies do.

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.919
And to give these companies the
certainty of knowing there will

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:38.853
be a market for what they sell,
I've set this goal for America:

00:02:38.853 --> 00:02:44.552
by 2035, 80% of electricity
should come from clean energy.

00:02:44.552 --> 00:02:48.586
This is going to help spark innovation
at businesses across America.

00:02:48.586 --> 00:02:51.619
This is going to spur new
products and technologies.

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:55.019
This is going to lead
to good, new jobs.

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.653
And that's how we
win the future --

00:02:56.653 --> 00:03:00.085
by unleashing the talent and
ingenuity of American businesses

00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:03.653
and American workers in every
corner of this country.

00:03:03.653 --> 00:03:06.052
So to those who say that
America's best days are behind

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:10.252
them, let them come
here, to Manitowoc.

00:03:10.252 --> 00:03:12.552
Let them come to this
once-shuttered factory that is

00:03:12.552 --> 00:03:16.985
now bustling with workers building
new technologies for the world.

00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:21.486
Let them come here to see the
incredible promise of our country.

00:03:21.486 --> 00:03:23.052
This is the future.

00:03:23.052 --> 00:03:24.886
And it is bright.

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:25.985
Thank you.
