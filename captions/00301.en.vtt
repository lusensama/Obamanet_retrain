00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:10.000
Last week, I spent a few days in California, talking with ordinary Americans

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.300
in town halls and in the places they work. We talked about their struggles,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.300
and we talked about their hopes. At the end of the day, these men and women 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.300
weren't as concerned with the news of the day in Washington as they were

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.200
about the very real and very serious challenges their families face every day:

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.400
whether they'll have a job and a paycheck to count on;

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.400
whether they'll be able to pay their medical bills or afford college tuition;

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.300
whether they'll be able to leave their children a world that's safer 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.000
and more prosperous than the one we have now. 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.200
Those are the concerns I heard about in California. 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.200
They’re the concerns I've heard about in letters from people throughout 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.000
this country for the last two years. And they are the concerns

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.000
addressed in the budget I sent to Congress last month.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.500
With the magnitude of the challenges we face, I don't just view this budget

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.500
as numbers on a page or a laundry list of programs. It’s an economic

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.300
blueprint for our future -- a vision of America where growth is not based

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.000
on real estate bubbles or over-leveraged banks, but on a firm foundation

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.200
of investments in energy, education, and health care

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.500
that will lead to a real and lasting prosperity.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.800
These investments are not a wish list of priorities that I picked out 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.000
of thin air – they’re a central part of a comprehensive strategy to grow this

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.400
economy by attacking the very problems that have dragged it down for

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.000
too long: the high cost of health care and our dependence on foreign oil;

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.000
our education deficit and our fiscal deficit.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.700
Now, as the House and the Senate take up this budget next week, the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.200
specific details and dollar amounts in this budget will undoubtedly change.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.100
That’s a normal and healthy part of the process.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.000
But when all is said and done,

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.400
I expect a budget that meets four basic principles.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.200
First, it must reduce our dependence on dangerous foreign oil and finally

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.300
put this nation on a path to a clean, renewable energy future.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.000
There’s no longer a doubt that the jobs and industries of tomorrow 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.000
will involve harnessing renewable sources of energy.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.000
The only question is whether America will lead that future.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.200
I believe we can and we will, and that's why we've proposed a budget that 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.300
makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy, while investing

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.200
in technologies like wind power and solar power; advanced biofuels, clean coal,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.500
and fuel-efficient cars and trucks that can be built right here in America. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Second, this budget must renew our nation's commitment to a complete

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.000
and competitive education for every American child. In this global economy,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.400
we know the countries that out-educate us today will out-compete us tomorrow, 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.200
and we know that our students are already falling behind their counterparts

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.200
in places like China. That’s why we have proposed investments in childhood

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.000
education programs that work; in high standards and accountability for our schools;

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.000
in rewards for teachers who succeed; and in affordable college education for

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.000
anyone who wants to go.  It is time to demand excellence from our schools

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.200
so that we can finally prepare our workforce for a 21st century economy.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.500
Third, we need a budget that makes a serious investment in health care reform --

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.100
reform that will bring down costs, ensure quality, and guarantee people their

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.000
choice of doctors and hospitals. Right now, there are millions of Americans

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.500
who are just one illness or medical emergency away from bankruptcy.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.700
There are businesses that have been forced to close their doors or ship jobs

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.300
overseas because they can't afford insurance. Medicare costs are consuming

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.000
our federal budget. Medicaid is overwhelming our state budgets.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.200
So to those who say we have to choose between health care reform and fiscal

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.600
discipline, I say that making investments now that will dramatically lower

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.400
health care costs for everyone won't add to our budget deficit in the long-term

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.400
it’s one of the best ways to reduce it.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Finally, this budget must reduce that deficit even further.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.000
With the fiscal mess we've inherited and the cost of this financial crisis,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.000
I've proposed a budget that cuts our deficit in half by the end of my first term.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.200
That's why we are scouring every corner of the budget and have proposed 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.200
$2 trillion in deficit reductions over the next decade.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.400
In total, our budget would bring discretionary spending for domestic programs

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.000
as a share of the economy to its lowest level in nearly half a century.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.000
And we will continue making these tough choices in the months and years ahead

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.300
so that as our economy recovers, we do what we must to bring down this deficit.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.000
I’ll be discussing each of these principles next week, as Congress takes up the

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.100
important work of debating this budget. I realize there are those who say these

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.100
plans are too ambitious to enact. To that I say that the challenges we face 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.800
are too large to ignore. I didn't come here to pass on our problems to the

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.000
next President or the next generation -- I came here to solve them.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.000
The American people sent us here to get things done, and at this moment of great 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.300
challenge, they are watching and waiting for us to lead. Let's show them 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.000
that we’re equal to the task before us, and let's pass a budget that 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.200
puts this nation on the road to lasting prosperity.
