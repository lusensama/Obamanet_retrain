00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:11.261
The President:
Earlier this week, we did
something that's never been done

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:14.461
here at the White House --
we had a Twitter Town Hall.

00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:17.661
I even sent my first
live tweet as President.

00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:20.428
The questions at the town hall
were sent in from across the

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:22.994
country and covered
all kinds of topics --

00:00:22.994 --> 00:00:27.027
from jobs and the economy
to education and energy.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.328
Lots of people also submitted
different versions of

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:30.895
another question.

00:00:30.895 --> 00:00:33.061
They'd start by saying
that our politics has grown

00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:34.895
so contentious.

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:38.094
Then they'd ask, when will
both parties in Congress come

00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:41.828
together on behalf of the
people who elected them?

00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:43.494
That's a really
important question,

00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:46.027
and it goes to the heart of a
debate we're having right now in

00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:49.328
this country -- and that's the
debate about how to tackle the

00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:52.294
problem of our
deficits and our debt.

00:00:52.294 --> 00:00:55.261
Now, there are obviously real
differences in approach.

00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:57.728
I believe we need a
balanced approach.

00:00:57.728 --> 00:01:00.561
That means taking on spending in
our domestic programs and our

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:02.194
defense programs.

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:04.528
It means addressing the
challenges in programs like

00:01:04.528 --> 00:01:08.227
Medicare so we can strengthen
those programs and protect them

00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:10.361
for future generations.

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:13.294
And it means taking on
spending in the tax code --

00:01:13.294 --> 00:01:15.695
spending on tax breaks
and deductions for the

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:17.928
wealthiest Americans.

00:01:17.928 --> 00:01:20.761
But I also know that Republicans
and Democrats don't see eye to

00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:22.828
eye on a number of issues.

00:01:22.828 --> 00:01:25.294
And so, we're going to continue
working over the weekend to

00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:27.094
bridge those gaps.

00:01:27.094 --> 00:01:30.528
The good news is, we agree
on some of the big things.

00:01:30.528 --> 00:01:34.194
We agree that after a decade of
racking up deficits and debt,

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:37.094
we need to get our
fiscal house in order.

00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:39.628
We agree that to do that, both
sides are going to have to step

00:01:39.628 --> 00:01:42.294
outside of their comfort
zones and make some

00:01:42.294 --> 00:01:44.361
political sacrifices.

00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:47.695
And we agree that we simply
cannot afford to default on our

00:01:47.695 --> 00:01:51.194
national obligations for the
first time in our history;

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.861
that we need to uphold the full
faith and credit of the United

00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:55.828
States of America.

00:01:55.828 --> 00:01:58.561
With a recovery that's still
fragile and isn't producing all

00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:02.361
the jobs we need, the last
thing we can afford is the usual

00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:04.861
partisan game-playing
in Washington.

00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:06.661
By getting our fiscal
house in order,

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:09.261
Congress will be in a stronger
position to focus on some of the

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:12.161
job-creating measures
I've already proposed --

00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:13.994
like putting people to
work rebuilding America's

00:02:13.994 --> 00:02:17.227
infrastructure, or reforming
our patent system so that our

00:02:17.227 --> 00:02:20.127
innovators and entrepreneurs
have a greater incentive to

00:02:20.127 --> 00:02:23.227
generate new products, or
making college more affordable

00:02:23.227 --> 00:02:24.728
for families.

00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:26.761
And businesses that may be
holding back because the

00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:29.795
uncertainty surrounding the
possibility of a default by the

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:32.328
United States government will
have greater confidence to

00:02:32.328 --> 00:02:34.728
invest and create jobs.

00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:36.361
I know we can do this.

00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:38.428
We can meet our
fiscal challenge.

00:02:38.428 --> 00:02:41.161
That's what the American
people sent us here to do.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:44.094
They didn't send us to kick
our problems down the road.

00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:46.861
That's exactly what they
don't like about Washington.

00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:48.994
They sent us here
to work together.

00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:51.594
They sent us here
to get things done.

00:02:51.594 --> 00:02:53.895
Right now, we have
an extraordinary --

00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:56.961
and an extraordinarily rare --
opportunity to move forward in a

00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:58.795
way that makes sure our
government lives within its

00:02:58.795 --> 00:03:02.394
means, that puts our economy
on a sounder footing for the

00:03:02.394 --> 00:03:06.594
future, and that still invests
in the things we need to prosper

00:03:06.594 --> 00:03:08.394
in the years to come.

00:03:08.394 --> 00:03:10.861
And I'm hopeful that we
will rise to the moment,

00:03:10.861 --> 00:03:14.127
and seize this opportunity,
on behalf of all Americans,

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.528
and the future we
hold in common.

00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:18.861
Thanks everybody, and
have a great weekend.
