00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:09.358
The President:
This week, I laid out my
plan for our fiscal future.

00:00:09.358 --> 00:00:12.091
It's a balanced plan that
reduces spending and brings down

00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:17.458
the deficit, putting America back
on track toward paying down our debt.

00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:19.991
We know why this
challenge is so critical.

00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:23.658
If we don't act, a rising tide
of borrowing will damage our

00:00:23.658 --> 00:00:27.958
economy, costing us jobs and
risking our future prosperity by

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.692
sticking our children
with the bill.

00:00:30.692 --> 00:00:33.224
At the same time, we have to
take a balanced approach to

00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:35.925
reducing our deficit -- an
approach that protects the

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:38.925
middle class, our
commitments to seniors,

00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:43.892
and job-creating investments in
things like education and clean energy.

00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:46.558
What's required is an approach
that draws support from both

00:00:46.558 --> 00:00:49.191
parties, and one that's
based on the values of shared

00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:52.725
responsibility and
shared prosperity.

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:55.224
Now, one plan put forward by
some Republicans in the House of

00:00:55.224 --> 00:00:59.491
Representatives aims to reduce
our deficit by $4 trillion over

00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:01.525
the next 10 years.

00:01:01.525 --> 00:01:03.391
But while I think
their goal is worthy,

00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:06.591
I believe their vision
is wrong for America.

00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:08.925
It's a vision that says at a
time when other nations are

00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:11.425
hustling to out-compete us for
the jobs and businesses of

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:14.958
tomorrow, we have to make
drastic cuts in education,

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.391
infrastructure,
and clean energy --

00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:20.158
the very investments we need
to win that competition and get

00:01:20.158 --> 00:01:22.091
those good jobs.

00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:24.692
It's a vision that says that in
order to reduce the deficit,

00:01:24.692 --> 00:01:26.692
we have to end
Medicare as we know it,

00:01:26.692 --> 00:01:30.124
and make cuts to Medicaid that
would leave millions of seniors,

00:01:30.124 --> 00:01:33.291
poor children, and Americans
with disabilities without the

00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:35.158
care they need.

00:01:35.158 --> 00:01:37.991
But even as this plan
proposes these drastic cuts,

00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:41.658
it would also give $1 trillion
in tax breaks to the wealthiest

00:01:41.658 --> 00:01:46.258
2% of Americans -- an extra
$200,000 for every millionaire

00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:48.591
and billionaire in the country.

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:50.458
I don't think that's right.

00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:53.258
I don't think it's right to ask
seniors to pay thousands more

00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:56.825
for health care, or ask
students to postpone college,

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:59.425
just so we don't have to ask
those who have prospered so much

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:03.558
in this land of opportunity
to give back a little more.

00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:05.525
To restore fiscal
responsibility,

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:08.024
we all need to share
in the sacrifice --

00:02:08.024 --> 00:02:11.725
but we don't have to sacrifice
the America we believe in.

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:14.224
That's why I've proposed a
balanced approach that matches

00:02:14.224 --> 00:02:17.458
that $4 trillion in
deficit reduction.

00:02:17.458 --> 00:02:20.258
It's an approach that combs
the entire budget for savings,

00:02:20.258 --> 00:02:22.625
and asks everyone
to do their part.

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:25.425
And I've called on Democrats and
Republicans to join me in this

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:28.925
effort -- to put aside their
differences to help America meet

00:02:28.925 --> 00:02:30.692
this challenge.

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:32.892
That's how we've balanced
our budget before,

00:02:32.892 --> 00:02:35.124
and it's how we'll
succeed again.

00:02:35.124 --> 00:02:37.491
We'll build on the savings we
made from last week's bipartisan

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.991
budget agreement, while
protecting the job-creating

00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:43.291
investments that are
critical to our future.

00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:46.458
We'll find additional savings
in our defense budget.

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:48.858
Over the last two years, the
Secretary of Defense has taken

00:02:48.858 --> 00:02:52.224
on wasteful spending that does
nothing to protect our troops or

00:02:52.224 --> 00:02:57.024
our nation, saving $400 billion
in current and future spending.

00:02:57.024 --> 00:02:59.158
I believe we can do that again.

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:00.591
We'll reduce health
care spending,

00:03:00.591 --> 00:03:03.024
and strengthen Medicare and
Medicaid through common-sense

00:03:03.024 --> 00:03:06.525
reforms that will get rid of
wasteful subsidies and increase

00:03:06.525 --> 00:03:08.525
in efficiency.

00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:11.925
We'll reduce spending in our tax
code with tax reform that's fair

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:15.258
and simple -- so that the amount
of taxes you pay doesn't depend

00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:18.325
on how clever an
accountant you can afford.

00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:22.058
And we should end the tax cuts
for the wealthiest Americans, too.

00:03:22.058 --> 00:03:25.858
Because people like me
don't need another tax cut.

00:03:25.858 --> 00:03:29.258
So that's my approach to reduce
the deficit by $4 trillion over

00:03:29.258 --> 00:03:32.525
the next 12 years while
protecting the middle class,

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:35.925
keeping our promise to seniors,
and securing our investments in

00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:37.358
our future.

00:03:37.358 --> 00:03:40.625
I hope you'll check it out for
yourself on WhiteHouse.gov.

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:43.158
And while you're there, you can
also find what we're calling the

00:03:43.158 --> 00:03:45.091
taxpayer receipt.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:48.091
For the first time ever, there's
a way for you to see exactly how

00:03:48.091 --> 00:03:50.425
and where your tax
dollars are spent,

00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:52.991
and what's really at
stake in this debate.

00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:55.925
Going forward, Democrats and
Republicans in Washington will

00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:58.825
have our differences,
some of them strong.

00:03:58.825 --> 00:04:01.291
But you expect us to
bridge those differences.

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:04.158
You expect us to work
together and get this done.

00:04:04.158 --> 00:04:05.892
And I believe we can.

00:04:05.892 --> 00:04:08.725
I believe we can live within our
means and live up to the values

00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:10.925
we share as Americans.

00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:14.024
And in the weeks to come, I'll
work with anyone who's willing

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:15.958
to get it done.

00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.491
Thanks for listening.

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:18.792
And have a great weekend.
