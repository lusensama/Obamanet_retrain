00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:08.166
The President:
This week, when I addressed
the nation on Syria,

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.867
I said that - in part
because of the credible threat

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:12.867
of U.S. military force -

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:16.834
there is the possibility
of a diplomatic solution.

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:19.200
Russia has indicated
a new willingness to join

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.533
with the international community

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:24.266
in pushing Syria to
give up its chemical weapons,

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.233
which the Assad regime
used in an attack

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:30.400
that killed more than
1,000 people on August 21.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.033
I also asked Congress to
postpone a vote on the use

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:36.200
of military force while we
pursue this diplomatic path.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.567
And that's what we're doing.

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:40.900
At my direction,
Secretary of State Kerry

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.900
is in discussions
with his Russian counterpart.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.333
But we're making it clear that
this can't be a stalling tactic.

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:51.100
Any agreement needs to verify
that the Assad regime and Russia

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.800
are keeping their commitments:

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.900
that means working to turn 
Syria's chemical weapons over

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.633
to international control

00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:00.233
and ultimately
destroying them.

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:02.500
This would allow us
to achieve our goal -

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.767
deterring the Syrian regime
from using chemical weapons,

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:07.934
degrading their
ability to use them,

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:09.800
and making it clear to the world

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.734
that we won't
tolerate their use.

00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:15.066
We've seen indications
of progress.

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.467
As recently as a week ago,

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:18.467
the Assad regime
would not admit

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:20.500
that it possessed
chemical weapons.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.033
Today, it does.

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:26.200
Syria has signaled a willingness
to join with 189 other nations,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.567
representing
98 percent of humanity,

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:30.934
in abiding by
an international agreement

00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:33.633
that prohibits the use
of chemical weapons.

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:35.467
And Russia has staked
its own credibility

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:37.200
on supporting this outcome.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.333
These are all
positive developments.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.100
We'll keep working with
the international community

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.467
to see that Assad
gives up his chemical weapons

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:45.600
so that they can be destroyed.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.166
We will continue
rallying support

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:48.367
from allies around the world

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:50.300
who agree on
the need for action

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.367
to deter the use
of chemical weapons in Syria.

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:55.967
And if current discussions
produce a serious plan,

00:01:55.967 --> 00:01:58.400
I'm prepared to move
forward with it.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.367
But we are not just
going to take Russia

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:03.066
and Assad's word for it.

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.834
We need to see concrete actions
to demonstrate that Assad

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.867
is serious about giving up
his chemical weapons.

00:02:07.867 --> 00:02:09.900
And since this plan emerged

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.166
only with a credible threat
of U.S. military action,

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.734
we will maintain our
military posture in the region

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:18.767
to keep the pressure
on the Assad regime.

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:20.000
And if diplomacy fails,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.100
the United States and 
the international community

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.834
must remain prepared to act.

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:27.700
The use of chemical weapons
anywhere in the world

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.800
is an affront to human dignity

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.934
and a threat to the security
of people everywhere.

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:34.200
As I have said for weeks,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.667
the international community
must respond to this outrage.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:39.166
A dictator must not be allowed

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:42.800
to gas children in
their beds with impunity.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.300
And we cannot risk poison gas

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.834
becoming the new
weapon of choice

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:49.667
for terrorists and
tyrants the world over.

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:52.200
We have a duty to preserve
a world free from the fear

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.433
of chemical weapons
for our children.

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:56.433
But if there is any chance
of achieving that goal

00:02:56.433 --> 00:02:58.100
without resorting to force,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.900
then I believe we
have a responsibility

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.166
to pursue that path.

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:04.166
Thank you.
