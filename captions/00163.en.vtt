00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.767
The President:
On Friday, we learned that
more than two dozen people were

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:11.934
killed when a gunman opened
fire in an elementary school in

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:14.066
Newtown, Connecticut.

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:17.300
Most of those who died were just
young children with their whole

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.867
lives ahead of them.

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:23.033
And every parent in America
has a heart heavy with hurt.

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:25.000
Among the fallen
were also teachers --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.767
men and women who devoted their
lives to helping our children

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:29.967
fulfill their dreams.

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:32.900
So our hearts are broken today.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.734
We grieve for the
families of those we lost.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:39.734
And we keep in our prayers the
parents of those who survived.

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:42.633
Because as blessed as they are
to have their children home,

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:45.934
they know that their child's
innocence has been torn away far

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:48.000
too early.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.467
As a nation, we have endured far
too many of these tragedies in

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:53.500
the last few years.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.500
An elementary school in Newtown.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.367
A shopping mall in Oregon.

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:59.934
A house of worship in Wisconsin.

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.667
A movie theater in Colorado.

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:05.300
Countless street corners
in places like Chicago

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.967
and Philadelphia.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.834
Any of these neighborhoods
could be our own.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:12.900
So we have to come together and
we're going to have to take

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.300
meaningful action to prevent
more tragedies like this

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.000
from happening.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.834
Regardless the politics.

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:23.934
This weekend, Michelle and I are
doing what I know every parent

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:28.433
is doing -- holding our children
as close as we can and reminding

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:30.667
them how much we love them.

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:32.700
There are families in
Connecticut who can't do

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.233
that today.

00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:37.300
And they need all
of us right now.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.000
Because while nothing can take
the place of a lost child or

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.266
loved one, all of us can extend
a hand to those in need --

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:47.133
to remind them that
we're there for them;

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:50.367
that we're praying for them;
and that the love they felt for

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:53.266
those they lost endures not
just in their own memories,

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:58.367
but also in their community,
and in their country.

00:01:58.367 --> 00:01:59.633
Thank you and God bless you.
