00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:08.734
The President:
This week, I signed into law
a Wall Street reform bill that

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:11.567
will protect consumers and
our entire economy from the

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:13.734
recklessness and
irresponsibility that led to the

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:16.066
worst recession in our lifetime.

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:19.367
It's reform that will help put a
stop to the abusive practices of

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:21.934
mortgage lenders and
credit card companies.

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:25.000
It'll end taxpayer bailouts
of Wall Street firms.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.767
And it will finally bring the
shadowy deals that caused the

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:31.266
financial crisis into
the light of day.

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:34.166
Wall Street reform is a key
pillar of an overall economic

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.600
plan we've put in place to dig
ourselves out of this recession

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.967
and build an economy
for the long run --

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:42.467
an economy that makes America
more competitive and our

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:44.567
middle-class more secure.

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:47.266
It's a plan based on the Main
Street values of hard work and

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:51.333
responsibility -- and one that demands new accountability from

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.667
Wall Street to Washington.

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:55.934
Instead of giving tax breaks
to corporations that ship jobs

00:00:55.934 --> 00:00:59.266
overseas, we want to give tax
breaks to small business owners

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:02.633
who are creating jobs
right here in America.

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:05.867
Already, we've given small
businesses eight new tax cuts,

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:10.266
and have expanded lending to more than 60,000 small business owners.

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.900
We're also investing
in a homegrown,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.700
clean energy industry -- because I don't want to see new solar

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.433
panels and wind turbines and electric cars manufactured in

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:20.000
some other country.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.500
I want to see them made in
America, by American workers.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.834
So far, we've provided new
tax credits, loan guarantees,

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:30.667
and investments that will lead to more than 800,000 clean

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:33.233
energy jobs by 2012.

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:36.200
And throughout America,
communities are being rebuilt by

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.633
people working in hundreds of
thousands of new private sector

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:44.100
jobs repairing our roads,
and bridges, and railways.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.600
Our economic plan is also
aimed at strengthening the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.834
middle-class.

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:51.900
That's why we've cut taxes
for 95% of working families.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.800
That's why we've offered tax
credits that have made college

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.333
more affordable for
millions of students,

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.900
and why we're making a new
commitment to our community colleges.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.633
And that's why we passed health
insurance reform that will stop

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:07.367
insurance companies from
dropping or denying coverage

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:11.100
based on an illness or
pre-existing condition.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.033
This is our economic plan -- smart investments in America's

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:17.567
small businesses, America's clean energy industry,

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:19.600
and America's middle-class.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.033
Now, I can't tell you that this
plan will bring back all the

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:26.600
jobs we've lost and restore
our economy to full strength overnight.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.367
The truth is, it took nearly
a decade of failed economic

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:32.567
policies to create this mess,
and it will take years to fully

00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:34.133
repair the damage.

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:37.667
But I'm confident that we are
finally headed in the right direction.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:39.233
We are moving forward.

00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:41.600
And what we can't afford right
now is to go back to the same

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.467
ideas that created this
mess in the first place.

00:02:45.467 --> 00:02:48.033
Unfortunately, those are the
ideas we keep hearing from our

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:49.967
friends in the other party.

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:53.400
This week, the Republican leader
in the House of Representatives

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.867
offered his plan to create jobs.

00:02:55.867 --> 00:03:00.400
It's a plan that's surprisingly
short, and sadly familiar.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.000
First, he would repeal
health insurance reform,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.834
which would take away tax
credits from millions of small

00:03:05.834 --> 00:03:08.767
business owners, and take us
back to the days when insurance

00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:13.133
companies had free rein to drop
coverage and jack up premiums.

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:17.300
Second, he would say no to new
investments in clean energy,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.367
after his party already voted
against the clean energy tax

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:23.533
credits and loans that are
creating thousands of new jobs

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:25.734
and hundreds of new businesses.

00:03:25.734 --> 00:03:29.066
And third, even though his party
voted against tax cuts for

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:32.367
middle-class families, he would
permanently keep in place the

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:35.767
tax cuts for the very
wealthiest Americans --

00:03:35.767 --> 00:03:40.333
the same tax cuts that have
added hundreds of billions to our debt.

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:42.300
These aren't new ideas.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.800
They're the same policies that
led us into this recession.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.000
They won't create jobs;
they will kill them.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.500
They won't reduce our deficit; they will add $1 trillion to our deficit.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.200
They will take us backward at
a time when we need to keep

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.133
America moving forward.

00:03:59.133 --> 00:04:00.834
I know times are tough.

00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:03.367
I know that the progress we've
made isn't good enough for the

00:04:03.367 --> 00:04:06.533
millions of Americans who are
still out of work or struggling

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:08.200
to pay the bills.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.867
But I also know the
character of this nation.

00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:13.767
I know that in times of great
challenge and difficulty,

00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:17.400
we don't fear the future
-- we shape the future.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.867
We harness the skills and
ingenuity of the most dynamic

00:04:20.867 --> 00:04:23.834
country on Earth to
reach a better day.

00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:27.433
We do it with optimism, and
we do it with confidence.

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.600
That's the spirit
we need right now,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.233
and that's the future I
know we can build together.

00:04:33.233 --> 00:04:34.433
Thanks.
