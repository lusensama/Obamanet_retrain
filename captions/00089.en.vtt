00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.967
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.233
This week, I spent
a couple days

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:15.200
in Minneapolis, talking with
people about their

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.633
lives - their concerns, their
successes,

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:20.033
and their hopes for the future.

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.333
I went because of a letter
I received from a working

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.934
mother named Rebekah,
who shared with

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:28.667
me the hardships her young
family has faced

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:31.000
since the financial crisis.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.266
She and her husband Ben
were just newlyweds

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.367
expecting their first
child, Jack,

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:38.934
when the housing crash dried up
his contracting business.

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:40.767
He took what jobs he
could, and Rebekah

00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:42.400
took out student loans and
retrained

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.166
for a new career.

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.333
They sacrificed - for
their kids,

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.867
and for each other.

00:00:47.867 --> 00:00:50.433
And five years later,
they've paid off debt,

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:51.867
bought their first home,

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:53.233
and had their second son, Henry.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.300
In her letter to me, she
wrote, "We are a strong,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.533
tight-knit family who has
made it through

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.500
some very, very hard times."

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.266
And in many ways, that's
America's

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.633
story these past five years.

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:08.000
We are a strong,
tight-knit family

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.934
that's made it through some
very tough times.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.367
Today, over the past 51
months,

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:17.467
our businesses have created 9.4
million new jobs.

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:19.266
By measure after measure,
our economy

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.166
is doing better than it was
five years ago.

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:23.967
But as Rebekah also wrote
in her letter,

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:26.066
there are still too many
middle-class families

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:29.133
like hers who do everything
right - who work hard

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:32.934
and who sacrifice - but
can't seem to get ahead.

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:35.533
It feels like the odds
are stacked against them.

00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:36.900
And with just a small
change

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.834
in our priorities, we could fix that.

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:42.066
The problem is,
Republicans in Congress

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:44.834
keep blocking or voting
down almost every serious

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:47.633
idea to strengthen
the middle class.

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:49.367
This year alone, they've
said no to raising

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:52.934
the minimum wage, no to fair
pay, no to student

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:57.467
loan reform, no to extending
unemployment insurance.

00:01:57.467 --> 00:01:59.567
And rather than invest
in education that helps

00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:01.734
working families get
ahead, they actually

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:03.467
voted to give another massive

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:05.433
tax cut to the wealthiest Americans.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.000
This obstruction keeps the
system rigged for those

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.233
at the top, and rigged
against the middle class.

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:13.533
And as long as they insist
on doing

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:17.700
it, I'll keep taking actions on
my own - like the actions

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.266
I've taken already to attract
new jobs, lift workers'

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:24.433
wages, and help students
pay off their loans.

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:25.533
I'll do my job.

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:27.734
And if it makes
Republicans in Congress

00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:29.000
mad that I'm trying to
help people

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.600
out, they can join me, and we'll
do it together.

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:38.200
The point is, we could do
so much more as a country

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.500
- as a strong, tight-knit
family -

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.433
if Republicans in Congress were
less interested in stacking

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:48.266
the deck for those at the top,
and more interested

00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:50.166
in growing the economy
for everybody.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.400
So rather than more tax
breaks for millionaires,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.033
let's give more tax breaks
to help working

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:58.000
families pay for child
care or college.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.567
Rather than protect tax
loopholes that

00:02:59.567 --> 00:03:02.900
let big corporations set up tax
shelters overseas,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.266
let's put people to work
rebuilding

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:07.066
roads and bridges right
here in America.

00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:08.467
Rather than stack the
decks in favor

00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:11.133
of those who've already
succeeded, let's realize

00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:14.500
that we are stronger as a nation
when we offer a fair shot

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.500
to every American.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.266
I'm going to spend some
time talking about

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:20.734
these very choices in
the week ahead.

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:23.133
That's because we know
from our history

00:03:23.133 --> 00:03:25.233
that our economy doesn't grow
from the top-down,

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:27.533
it grows from the middle-out.

00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:30.834
We do better when the
middle class does better.

00:03:30.834 --> 00:03:32.767
That's the American way.

00:03:32.767 --> 00:03:34.367
That's what I believe in.

00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:35.567
And that's what I'll
keep fighting for.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.333
Have a great Fourth of
July, everybody -

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:40.533
and good luck to Team USA
down in Brazil.

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:46.533
Thanks.
