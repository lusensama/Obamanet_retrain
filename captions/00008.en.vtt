00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.078
The President: Hello, everybody.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:14.948
This past week, we lost an
American icon and one of the

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:18.651
most influential figures of
her time - former First Lady

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.420
Nancy Reagan.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.590
Born in New York City, and
raised mostly in Chicago,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.094
Nancy Davis graduated from
Smith College in 1943.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:30.997
As an actress, she
appeared in 11 films.

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:33.700
And off-screen, she starred
in a real-life Hollywood

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.537
romance with the love of
her life, Ronald Reagan,

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:40.874
whom she married in 1952.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.042
As President, I know just
how important it is to have

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.979
a strong life partner, and
President Reagan was as

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.680
lucky as I am.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.783
Nancy Reagan redefined the
role of First Lady

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.551
of the United States.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.887
In addition to serving as
a trusted advisor to her

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:57.123
husband, and an elegant
hostess for our nation,

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.192
she was a passionate
advocate for issues that

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:01.461
touched the
lives of so many.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.497
She raised awareness about
drug and alcohol abuse.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:07.667
She was a staunch supporter
of America's veterans.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.036
And after her own battle
with breast cancer and a

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:13.072
mastectomy, she spoke in
personal terms about the

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:16.176
need for women to
get mammograms.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.445
The American people were
deeply moved by the love

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.647
Nancy felt for her husband.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:23.983
And we were inspired by
how, in their long goodbye,

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.286
Nancy became a voice on
behalf of millions of

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.288
families experiencing
the depleting,

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:31.624
aching reality of
Alzheimer's disease.

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.893
She brought her
characteristic intelligence

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:37.263
and focus to the twin causes
of stem cell research and

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.065
Alzheimer's research.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:42.101
And when I signed an order
to resume federal stem cell

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.504
research, I was proud that
she was one of the first

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:46.973
phone calls I made.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:49.142
Nobody understood better
than Nancy Reagan the

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.144
importance of pursuing
treatments that hold the

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:55.181
potential and the promise
to improve and save lives.

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.717
That's why, last year, my
administration announced the

00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:00.086
Precision Medicine
Initiative to advance our

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:03.056
ability to tailor health
care and treat diseases like

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:06.292
cancer and Alzheimer's by
accounting for individual

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.695
differences in people's
genes, environments,

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.396
and lifestyles.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.732
Last month, we took new
actions to foster more

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:15.435
collaboration between
researchers, doctors,

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:19.105
patients, data systems,
and beyond to accelerate

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:20.740
precision medicine.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.742
And more than 40
organizations stepped up

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:25.812
with new commitments in
this cutting-edge field.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.814
We've also launched the
BRAIN initiative to

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.816
revolutionize our
understanding of how the

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.085
human brain works.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.387
Thanks to the tireless
efforts of people like Nancy

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:37.123
Reagan, I've never been
more optimistic that we are

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:40.026
getting closer to the day
when every single patient

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:42.762
can get the care they
need and deserve.

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:44.764
I've never been more
optimistic that we will one

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:47.033
day find a cure for
devastating diseases

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.034
like Alzheimer's.

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:51.104
And I can think of no better
way to honor our former

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:54.073
First Lady's legacy than
by working together,

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:57.310
as one nation,
toward that goal.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.912
Thanks, everybody.
