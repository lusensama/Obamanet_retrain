00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.344
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:15.315
Five years ago, after the worst
financial crisis in decades,

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.284
we passed historic Wall Street
reform to end the era of

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:20.954
bailouts and too big to fail.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:24.057
As part that reform, we created
an independent Consumer

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:28.361
Financial Protection Bureau with
one mission: to protect American

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.064
consumers from some of the worst
practices of the

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.133
financial industry.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.703
They've already put $5 billion
back in the pockets of more than

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.805
15 million families.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:41.274
And this week, they took an
important first step towards

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:44.911
cracking down on some of the
most abusive practices involving

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.213
payday loans.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.483
Millions of Americans take
out these loans every year.

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.585
In Alabama, where I
visited this week,

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.688
there are four times as many
payday lending stores as there

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:57.490
are McDonald's.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.293
But while payday loans
might seem like easy money,

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:03.029
folks often end up trapped
in a cycle of debt.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:07.400
If you take out a $500 loan,
it's easy to wind up paying more

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.970
than $1,000 in
interest and fees.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.640
The step the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau announced this

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.875
week is designed to change that.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.878
The idea is pretty common sense:
if you're a payday lender

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:21.781
preparing to give a loan, you
should make sure that the

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:25.385
borrower can afford
to pay it back first.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.487
As Americans, we believe there's
nothing wrong with making

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:28.488
a profit.

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.623
But there is something wrong
with making that profit by

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:33.726
trapping hard-working men and
women in a vicious cycle

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.195
of debt.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:37.597
Protecting working Americans'
paychecks shouldn't be a

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.332
partisan issue.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:42.836
But the budget Republicans
unveiled last week would make it

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:45.572
harder, not easier, to crack
down on financial fraud

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.006
and abuse.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.143
And this week, when Republicans
rolled out their next economic

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.145
idea, it had nothing to
do with the middle class.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:57.050
It was a new, more-than-$250
billion tax cut for the top

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.253
one-tenth of the top one
percent of Americans.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:04.290
That would mean handing out an
average tax cut of $4 million a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.794
year to just 4,000
Americans per year,

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.763
and leaving the rest of
the country to pay for it.

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:13.333
I don't think our top economic
priority should be helping a

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.969
tiny number of Americans who are
already doing extraordinarily

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.606
well, and asking everybody
else to foot the bill.

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:22.509
I think our top priority should
be helping everybody who works

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.210
hard get ahead.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.213
This country does best when
everyone gets their fair shot,

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:30.917
everyone does their fair share,
and everyone plays by the same

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:32.585
set of rules.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.821
That's what middle-class
economics is all about,

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.657
and as long as I'm
your President,

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:40.493
that's what I'll keep
on fighting to do.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:42.495
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
