00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.967
The President:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:09.300
In recent weeks, we've seen
signs that our economy is

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.233
growing stronger and creating
jobs at a faster clip.

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:15.400
While numbers and figures will
go up and down in the coming

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.767
months, what cannot waver is our
resolve to do everything in our

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:22.166
power to keep stoking the
fires of the recovery.

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:25.100
And the last thing we should
do is let Washington stand

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.700
in the way.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.567
You see, at the
end of the month,

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:33.166
taxes are set to go up on 160
million working Americans.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.033
If you're one of them, then you
know better than anyone that the

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:39.166
last thing you need
right now is a tax hike.

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:43.934
But if Congress refuses to act,
middle class taxes will go up.

00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:45.567
It's that simple.

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:47.967
Now, if this sounds familiar,
it's because we've been

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:49.500
here before.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.800
Back in December, Congress faced
this exact same predicament.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.834
Ultimately, thanks
to your voices,

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:58.600
they did the right thing --
but only after a great deal of

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.066
bickering and political
posturing that put the strength

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.533
of our economy and the
security of middle class

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.166
families at risk.

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.633
We can't go through that again.

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:10.000
Congress needs to stop
this middle class tax hike

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.200
from happening.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.333
Period.

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.367
No drama.

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:14.500
No delay.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.266
And no ideological side issues
that have nothing to do with

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.767
this tax cut.

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:21.333
Now is not the time for
self-inflicted wounds to

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.867
our recovery.

00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:25.500
Now is the time for
common-sense action.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.066
And this tax cut
is common-sense.

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:31.133
If you're a family making
about $50,000 a year,

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:34.767
this tax cut amounts
to about $1,000 a year.

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:37.734
That's about $40
in every paycheck.

00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:40.200
I know there are some folks in
this town who think $40 isn't a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.200
lot of money.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.000
But to a student or a senior
who's trying to stretch the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.467
budget a little bit further?

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:49.400
To a parent who's filling up
the tank and looking at rising

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.500
gas prices?

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.166
To them, $40 can make all
the difference in the world.

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.000
And so can your voice.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.533
I hope you'll pick up the phone,
send a tweet, write an email,

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:02.300
and tell your representative
that they should get this done

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.934
before it's too late.

00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:07.667
Tell them not to play politics
again by linking this debate to

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:09.233
unrelated issues.

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:12.033
Tell them not to manufacture
another needless standoff

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:13.300
or crisis.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.867
Tell them not to stand in
the way of the recovery.

00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:19.433
Tell them to just do their job.

00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:21.300
That's what our
middle class needs.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.266
That's what our country needs.

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:25.233
In the wake of the worst
economic crisis of our

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:27.667
lifetimes, we're getting
things going again.

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:30.266
And we're going to keep at
it until everyone shares in

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:32.200
America's comeback.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.900
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
