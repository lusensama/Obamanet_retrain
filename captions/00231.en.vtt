00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.600
The President:
For years, the government
has spent more money than

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.133
it takes in.

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:12.033
The result is a lot of debt on
our nation's credit card --

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.934
debt that unless we act
will weaken our economy,

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:17.300
cause higher interest
rates for families,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.867
and force us to scale
back things like education

00:00:19.867 --> 00:00:21.767
and Medicare.

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:23.700
Now, folks in Washington
like to blame one another for

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.600
this problem.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.333
But the truth is, neither
party is blameless.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.400
And both parties have a
responsibility to do something

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.834
about it.

00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:34.300
Every day, families are figuring
out how stretch their paychecks

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.300
-- struggling to cut what they
can't afford so they can pay for

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.266
what's really important.

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:42.300
It's time for Washington
to do the same thing.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.400
But for that to happen, it means
that Democrats and Republicans

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.633
have to work together.

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:49.967
It means we need to put aside
our differences to do what's

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:52.133
right for the country.

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:55.233
Everyone is going to have
to be willing to compromise.

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:57.767
Otherwise, we'll never
get anything done.

00:00:57.767 --> 00:01:00.500
That's why we need a balanced
approach to cutting the deficit.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.133
We need an approach that goes
after waste in the budget and

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.834
gets rid of pet projects that
cost billions of dollars.

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:08.967
We need an approach that makes
some serious cuts to worthy

00:01:08.967 --> 00:01:12.900
programs -- cuts I wouldn't
make under normal circumstances.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.800
And we need an approach that
asks everybody to do their part.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.800
So that means, yes, we have
to make serious budget cuts;

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.667
but that it's not right to ask
middle class families to pay

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:25.834
more for college before we ask
the biggest corporations to pay

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:28.066
their fair share of taxes.

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:31.300
It means that before we
stop funding clean energy,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.100
we should ask oil companies and
corporate jet owners to give up

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
the tax breaks that other
companies don't get.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.233
Before we cut medical research,
we should ask hedge fund

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:43.233
managers to stop paying
taxes at a lower rate than

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:45.033
their secretaries.

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:47.934
Before we ask seniors to
pay more for Medicare,

00:01:47.934 --> 00:01:50.600
we should ask the wealthiest
taxpayers to give up tax breaks

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.633
we simply can't afford
under these circumstances.

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:57.266
That's the heart of this
approach: serious cuts,

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:59.200
balanced by some new revenues.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.967
And it's been the position of
every Democratic and Republican

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:04.533
leader who has worked
to reduce the deficit,

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:06.934
from Bill Clinton
to Ronald Reagan.

00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:09.433
In fact, earlier this week, one
of the most conservative members

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:12.967
of the Senate, Tom Coburn,
announced his support for a

00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:16.367
balanced, bipartisan
plan that shows promise.

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:18.633
And then a funny thing happened.

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:20.433
He received a round
of applause --

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:23.333
from a group of Republican
and Democratic senators.

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:25.500
That's a rare event
in Washington.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.967
So there will be plenty of
haggling over the details in the

00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:29.233
days ahead.

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:32.266
But this debate boils
down to a simple choice.

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:34.467
We can come together for the
good of the country and reach a

00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:38.300
compromise; we can strengthen
our economy and leave for our

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.600
children a more secure future.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.734
Or we can issue insults and
demands and ultimatums at each

00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:46.600
other, withdraw to
our partisan corners,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.233
and achieve nothing.

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:50.567
Well, we know the
right thing to do.

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:53.233
And we know what the American
people expect us to do.
