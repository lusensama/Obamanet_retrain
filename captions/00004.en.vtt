00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.478
The President: Hi everybody.

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:13.747
Over the past seven years,
we haven't just been

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:16.383
recovering from crisis,
we've been rebuilding our

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:19.586
economy on a new foundation
for growth - growth that

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:23.123
benefits everybody, not just
folks at the top.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:27.026
Our businesses have created
jobs for 73 straight months

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:30.363
- 14.4 million new jobs in
all.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.399
We've covered another 20
million Americans with

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.700
health insurance.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.835
We've helped more Americans
afford college,

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.872
and invested in industries
that create good jobs that

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.473
pay well, like clean energy.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.475
And wages are finally rising
again.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.678
But there will always be
more work to do.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:48.081
And this week, my
Administration took two big

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.583
steps that will help make
sure your hard work is

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:53.720
rewarded, and that everybody
plays by the same rules.

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.690
First, we're helping more
Americans retire with

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.659
security and dignity.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.095
Right now, if you go to a
retirement advisor for

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:05.265
investment advice, some of
them don't have to act in

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:06.966
your best interest.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.302
Instead of telling you the
best way to save your

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:12.005
hard-earned money, these
advisors can get backdoor

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.641
payments from big companies
for steering you toward

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:18.111
investments that cost more
and earn you less.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.579
As a result, when you
retire,

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.015
you might be missing out on
tens of thousands of dollars

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:24.617
- because your advisor got
paid more to give you bad

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:25.618
advice.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:28.588
If that seems wrong, that's
because it is.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:31.124
That's why the Department of
Labor just finalized a rule

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:33.393
to crack down on these kinds
of conflicts of interest.

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:35.762
And a lot of Wall Street
special interests aren't

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:36.763
very happy about it.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.833
But across the country, this
new rule will boost working

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.469
folks' retirement savings by
billions of dollars a year.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.238
And it will level the
playing field for the many

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:48.374
good advisors who do work in
their clients' best

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.375
interest.

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:52.245
Second, the Treasury
Department took action to

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.481
crack down on big
corporations that change

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:58.151
their address overseas after
acquiring smaller companies,

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:00.753
in order to reduce their tax
bill here at home.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:03.122
It's a loophole called
"corporate inversion."

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.391
And it means that American
companies can take advantage

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.495
of America's technology,
America's infrastructure,

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.463
America's workers
- but then,

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.465
when it comes to paying
their fair share of taxes,

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.734
suddenly claim they're not
American companies after all.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.171
That's why, this week, the
Treasury Department made it

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:21.241
more difficult for companies
to exploit this loophole and

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.243
stick the rest of us with
the tab.

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:26.145
Together, these steps build
on the work we've already

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:28.615
done to make our tax code
fairer and consumer

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.450
protections stronger.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.452
Because I believe that
rather than double down on

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:34.787
policies that allow a few at
the top to play by their own

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.724
rules, we should build an
economy where everybody has

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:40.493
a fair shot, everybody does
their fair share,

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:42.729
and everybody plays by the
same set of rules.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.565
That's what this country is
all about.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.567
That's what we've been
working toward these past

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:48.568
seven years.

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.570
And that's what I'm going to
keep fighting for as long as

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.571
I'm your President.

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:52.939
Thanks everybody.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:53.940
Have a great weekend.
