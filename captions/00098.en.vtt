00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:09.658
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.692 --> 00:00:12.858
For millions of Americans,
this time of year

00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:13.858
holds great meaning.

00:00:14.892 --> 00:00:17.425
Earlier this week, we
hosted a Passover Seder

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:19.792
at the White House, and
joined Jewish families

00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:22.425
around the world in their
retellings of the story

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.825
of the Exodus and the victory
of faith over oppression.

00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.625
And this Sunday, Michelle,
Malia, Sasha,

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:31.991
and I will join our fellow
Christians around the world

00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:34.958
in celebrating the
Resurrection of Christ,

00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.825
the salvation he offered
the world,

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:38.925
and the hope that comes with
the Easter season.

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:42.525
These holy days have their
roots in miracles

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:44.658
that took place long ago.

00:00:44.658 --> 00:00:47.825
And yet, they still
inspire us, guide us,

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:49.958
and strengthen us today.

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.658
They remind us of our
responsibilities

00:00:51.658 --> 00:00:55.391
to God and, as God's children,
our responsibilities

00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:56.391
to one another.

00:00:57.124 --> 00:00:59.158
For me, and for countless
other Christians,

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.591
Holy Week and Easter are
times

00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:03.158
for reflection and renewal.

00:01:03.158 --> 00:01:05.291
We remember the grace of
an awesome God,

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:07.825
who loves us so deeply that He
gave us his only Son,

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:09.491
so that we might live through Him.

00:01:10.358 --> 00:01:13.425
We recall all that Jesus
endured for us -

00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:16.792
the scorn of the crowds, the
agony of the cross -

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:18.792
all so that we might be forgiven
our sins

00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:21.391
and granted everlasting life.

00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:24.491
And we recommit ourselves
to following His example,

00:01:24.491 --> 00:01:26.525
to love and serve one
another,

00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:29.091
particularly "the least of these" among us,

00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:30.892
just as He loves every one of us.

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:33.925
The common thread of
humanity that connects

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:37.825
us all - not just Christians
and Jews, but Muslims

00:01:37.825 --> 00:01:41.525
and Hindus and Sikhs - is our
shared commitment

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:43.958
to love our neighbors as
we love ourselves.

00:01:44.725 --> 00:01:47.091
To remember, I am my
brother's keeper.

00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:49.525
I am my sister's keeper.

00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:52.858
Whatever your faith,
believer or nonbeliever,

00:01:52.858 --> 00:01:55.692
there's no better time to
rededicate ourselves

00:01:55.692 --> 00:01:57.024
to that universal mission.

00:01:58.391 --> 00:02:01.591
For me, Easter is a story
of hope - a belief

00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:04.591
in a better day to come,
just around the bend.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:06.758
So to all Christians who
are celebrating,

00:02:06.758 --> 00:02:09.991
from my family to yours,
Happy Easter.

00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:12.625
And to every American,
have a joyful weekend.

00:02:13.725 --> 00:02:15.991
Thanks, God bless you, and
may God bless

00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:16.991
this country we love.
