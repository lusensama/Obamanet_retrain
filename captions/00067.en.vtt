00:00:10.234 --> 00:00:11.769
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.304
Just in time for
the holiday season,

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:15.206
we now have another
piece of good news

00:00:15.206 --> 00:00:17.742
about the pace of our
economic recovery.

00:00:17.742 --> 00:00:23.081
Last month, our businesses
created 314,000 new jobs.

00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:26.084
And that's not a fluke -
it keeps up the solid pace

00:00:26.084 --> 00:00:28.986
of job creation we've
seen all year long.

00:00:28.986 --> 00:00:30.988
November was the
tenth month in a row

00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:33.891
we've added more
than 200,000 jobs.

00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:35.893
So far this year, our
economy has created

00:00:35.893 --> 00:00:38.663
2.65 million new jobs.

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:40.665
That's the most of any
year since the 1990s -

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:43.568
even with a full
month to go.

00:00:43.568 --> 00:00:45.570
All told, our
businesses have created

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.273
10.9 million new jobs
over the past 57 months.

00:00:49.273 --> 00:00:51.242
And that's the longest
streak of private-sector

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:54.145
job creation on record.

00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:56.147
We also know that the
upswing in job growth

00:00:56.147 --> 00:00:59.550
this year has come in
industries with higher wages.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.219
Overall wages are
on the rise.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.354
And that's some very
welcome news for millions

00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:05.256
of hardworking Americans.

00:01:05.256 --> 00:01:08.159
Because even though corporate
profits and the stock market

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.962
have hit all-time highs,
the typical family isn't

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:13.164
bringing home more than
they did 15 years ago.

00:01:13.164 --> 00:01:15.066
And that still
has to change.

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:19.203
And a vibrant jobs market
gives us the opportunity

00:01:19.203 --> 00:01:21.305
to keep up this progress,
and begin to undo

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:24.709
that decades-long
middle-class squeeze.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.678
But first, we need the
outgoing Congress to pass

00:01:27.678 --> 00:01:30.314
a budget and keep
our government open.

00:01:30.314 --> 00:01:33.718
A Christmas shutdown
is not a good idea.

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:36.020
Then, when the new Congress
convenes in January,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.189
we need to work together
to invest in the things

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.759
that support faster growth
in higher-paying jobs.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.096
Building new roads and
bridges creates jobs.

00:01:45.096 --> 00:01:47.799
Growing our exports
creates jobs.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.801
Reforming our
outdated tax system

00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:53.137
and our broken immigration
system creates jobs.

00:01:53.137 --> 00:01:55.873
Raising the minimum wage would
benefit nearly 28 million

00:01:55.873 --> 00:01:58.075
American workers, giving
them more money to spend

00:01:58.075 --> 00:02:00.244
at local businesses -
and that helps those

00:02:00.244 --> 00:02:03.247
businesses create jobs.

00:02:03.247 --> 00:02:05.249
America, we still have a
lot of work to do together.

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:09.487
But we do have real, tangible
evidence of our progress.

00:02:09.487 --> 00:02:11.322
10.9 million new jobs.

00:02:11.322 --> 00:02:13.958
10 million more Americans
with health insurance.

00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.860
Manufacturing has grown.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.895
Our deficits have shrunk.

00:02:17.895 --> 00:02:19.964
Our dependence on
foreign oil is down.

00:02:19.964 --> 00:02:21.833
Clean energy is up.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:23.901
More young Americans are
graduating from high school

00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:25.903
and earning college
degrees than ever before.

00:02:25.903 --> 00:02:28.372
Over the last four
years, this country has

00:02:28.372 --> 00:02:30.842
put more people back to
work than Europe, Japan,

00:02:30.842 --> 00:02:33.277
and every advanced
economy combined.

00:02:33.277 --> 00:02:35.813
The United States of
America continues

00:02:35.813 --> 00:02:37.815
to outperform much
of the world.

00:02:37.815 --> 00:02:39.884
And we are going to keep it
up until every American

00:02:39.884 --> 00:02:42.019
feels the gains of a
growing economy where

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.323
it matters most -
in your own lives.

00:02:45.323 --> 00:02:47.124
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
