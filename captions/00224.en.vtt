00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:08.800
The President:
This weekend, we're coming
together, as one nation,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.567
to mark the 10th anniversary
of the September 11th attacks.

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:14.734
We're remembering
the lives we lost --

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:19.000
nearly 3,000 innocent
men, women and children.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.934
We're reaffirming our commitment
to always keep faith with

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:23.734
their families.

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:26.400
We're honoring the heroism of
first responders who risked

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.266
their lives -- and gave
their lives -- to save others.

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:33.767
And we're giving thanks to
all who serve on our behalf,

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.633
especially our troops
and military families --

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:39.533
our extraordinary
9/11 Generation.

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:43.233
At the same time, even as we
reflect on a difficult decade,

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:47.000
we must look forward, to the
future we will build together.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.400
That includes staying strong
and confident in the face of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.734
any threat.

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:52.533
And thanks to the tireless
efforts of our military

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:56.100
personnel and our intelligence,
law enforcement and homeland

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.867
security professionals --
there should be no doubt.

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:03.934
Today, America is stronger
and al Qaeda is on the path

00:01:03.934 --> 00:01:05.266
to defeat.

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.133
We've taken the fight to
al Qaeda like never before.

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.367
Over the past two
and a half years,

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:12.166
more senior al Qaeda leaders
have been eliminated than at any

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.100
time since 9/11.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.400
And thanks to the remarkable
courage and precision of our

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.500
forces, we finally delivered
justice to Osama bin Laden.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.200
We've strengthened the
partnerships and tools we need

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.600
to prevail in this
war against al Qaeda --

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.667
working closer with
allies and partners;

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:29.900
reforming intelligence to
better detect and disrupt plots;

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.934
investing in our Special
Forces so terrorists have no

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:34.400
safe haven.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.533
We're constantly working to
improve the security of our

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:40.333
homeland as well -- at our
airports, ports and borders;

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.734
enhancing aviation
security and screening;

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:45.233
increasing support for
our first responders;

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:47.767
and working closer
than ever with states,

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:50.033
cities and communities.

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:54.533
A decade after 9/11, it's clear
for all the world to see --

00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:57.367
the terrorists who attacked us
that September morning are no

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.533
match for the character
of our people,

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:03.767
the resilience of our nation,
or the endurance of our values.

00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:06.033
They wanted to terrorize
us, but, as Americans,

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:08.166
we refuse to live in fear.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.500
Yes we face a determined
foe, and make no mistake --

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.300
they will keep trying
to hit us again.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.000
But as we're showing again this
weekend, we remain vigilant.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.400
We're doing everything in our
power to protect our people.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.333
And no matter what comes our
way, as a resilient nation,

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.166
we will carry on.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.500
They wanted to draw
us in to endless wars,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.500
sapping our strength and
confidence as a nation.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.266
But even as we put relentless
pressure on al Qaeda,

00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:34.333
we're ending the war in Iraq and
beginning to bring our troops

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:36.100
home from Afghanistan.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.834
Because after a
hard decade of war,

00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:40.900
it is time for nation
building here at home.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.567
They wanted to deprive us of
the unity that defines us as

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:44.934
a people.

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:48.200
But we will not succumb
to division or suspicion.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.300
We are Americans, and we're
stronger and safer when we stay

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.467
true to the values, freedoms and
diversity that makes us unique

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:57.300
among nations.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.667
And they wanted to undermine
our place in the world.

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:03.200
But a decade later, we've shown
that America doesn't hunker down

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.700
and hide behind
walls of mistrust.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.200
We've forged new partnerships
with nations around the world to

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.433
meet the global challenges
that no nation can face alone.

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:15.433
And across the Middle East and
North Africa a new generation of

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:18.100
citizens is showing that the
future belongs to those that

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.700
want to build, not destroy.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.300
Ten years ago, ordinary
Americans showed us the true

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.166
meaning of courage when they
rushed up those stairwells,

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:30.667
into those flames,
into that cockpit.

00:03:30.667 --> 00:03:33.533
In the decade since, a new
generation has stepped forward

00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:35.967
to serve and keep us safe.

00:03:35.967 --> 00:03:40.734
In their memory, in their
name, we will never waver.

00:03:40.734 --> 00:03:44.667
We will protect the country
we love and pass it safer,

00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:49.033
stronger and more prosperous
to the next generation.
