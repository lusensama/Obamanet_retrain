00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.011
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:16.116
American leadership is the one
constant in an uncertain world.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.485
That was true this week, as
we mobilized the world

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:22.155
to confront some of our
most urgent challenges.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.591
America is leading the world
in the fight to degrade

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:28.228
and ultimately destroy the
terrorist group known as ISIL.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.897
On Monday, our brave men
and women in uniform began

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:33.833
air strikes against
ISIL targets in Syria.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:34.834
And they weren't alone.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:38.071
I made it clear that America
would act as part of a broad

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.341
coalition, and we were joined
in this action by friends

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.477
and partners, including
Arab nations.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.479
At the United
Nations in New York,

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.882
I worked to build more
support for this coalition;

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.985
to cut off terrorist financing;
and to stop the flow

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:55.455
of foreign fighters into
and out of that region.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.658
And in my address to the UN,
I challenged the world --

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:02.095
especially Muslim communities
- to reject the ideology

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:05.231
of violent extremism,
and to do more to tap

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.935
the extraordinary potential
of their young people.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.937
America is leading the
effort to rally the world

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:13.206
against Russian
aggression in Ukraine.

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.775
Along with our allies, we will
support the people of Ukraine

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:18.845
as they develop their
democracy and economy.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:21.748
And this week, I called upon
even more nations to join

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.551
us on the right side
of history.

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:26.686
America is leading the fight
to contain and combat

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:29.355
the Ebola epidemic
in West Africa.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:31.925
We're deploying our doctors
and scientists -- supported

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.661
by our military -- to
help corral the outbreak

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.729
and pursue new treatments.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.166
From the United Kingdom and
Germany to France and Senegal,

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.802
other nations are stepping
up their efforts, too,

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:45.605
sending money,
supplies, and personnel.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.874
And we will continue to rally
other countries to join

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.876
us in making concrete
commitments to fight

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:53.046
this disease, and enhance
global health security

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:55.148
for the long-term.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.150
America is engaging more
partners and allies than ever

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.319
to confront the growing threat
of climate change before

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.787
it's too late.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.789
We're doing our
part, and helping

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.557
developing nations
do theirs.

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:07.694
At home, we've invested in clean
energy, cut carbon pollution,

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:10.330
and created new
jobs in the process.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.799
Abroad, our climate
assistance now reaches

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.467
more than 120 nations.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:18.037
And on Tuesday, I called on
every nation - developed and

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:21.274
developing alike -- to join us
in this effort for the sake

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.442
of future generations.

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:27.080
The people of the world
look to us to lead.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.482
And we welcome that
responsibility.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.618
We are heirs to a proud
legacy of freedom.

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.120
And as we showed
the world this week,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.823
we are prepared to do what
is necessary to secure

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.926
that legacy for
generations to come.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:41.928
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
