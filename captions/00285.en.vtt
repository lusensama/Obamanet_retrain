00:00:08.861 --> 00:00:12.127
The President:
More than a decade ago, Congress set up a formula that governs

00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:15.294
how doctors get paid by
the Medicare program.

00:00:15.294 --> 00:00:18.328
The intent was to slow the
growth of Medicare costs,

00:00:18.328 --> 00:00:21.061
but the result was a formula
that has proposed cutting

00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:25.761
payments for America's doctors
year after year after year.

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:28.428
These are cuts that would not
only jeopardize our physicians'

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:31.361
pay, but our
seniors' health care.

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:35.194
Since 2003, Congress has acted
to prevent these pay cuts from

00:00:35.194 --> 00:00:36.861
going into effect.

00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:38.761
These votes were
largely bipartisan,

00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:41.994
and they succeeded when
Democrats ran Congress and when

00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:45.795
Republicans ran Congress -- which was most of the time.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.695
This year, a majority of
Congress is willing to prevent a

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:53.628
pay cut of 21% -- a pay cut that would undoubtedly force some

00:00:53.628 --> 00:00:57.461
doctors to stop seeing
Medicare patients altogether.

00:00:57.461 --> 00:01:00.895
But this time, some Senate
Republicans may even block a

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:02.895
vote on this issue.

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:05.594
After years of voting
to defer these cuts,

00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:08.194
the other party is now willing
to walk away from the needs of

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:10.728
our doctors and our seniors.

00:01:10.728 --> 00:01:13.561
Now, I realize that simply
kicking these cuts down the road

00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:16.661
another year is not a long-term
solution to this problem.

00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:19.528
For years, I have said that a
system where doctors are left to

00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:23.761
wonder if they'll get fairly
reimbursed makes absolutely no sense.

00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:25.661
And I'm committed to
permanently reforming this

00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:29.994
Medicare formula in a way that
balances fiscal responsibility

00:01:29.994 --> 00:01:33.328
with the responsibility we
have to doctors and seniors.

00:01:33.328 --> 00:01:35.928
In addition, we're already
taking significant steps to slow

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:39.227
the growth of Medicare costs
through health insurance reform

00:01:39.227 --> 00:01:41.261
-- not by targeting
doctors and seniors,

00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:44.027
but by eliminating 50%
of the waste, fraud,

00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:46.895
and abuse in the system by 2012.

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:48.594
This not only
strengthens Medicare,

00:01:48.594 --> 00:01:50.628
it saves taxpayer dollars.

00:01:50.628 --> 00:01:53.628
I'm absolutely willing to take
the difficult steps necessary to

00:01:53.628 --> 00:01:56.127
lower the cost of Medicare
and put our budget on a more

00:01:56.127 --> 00:01:58.161
fiscally sustainable path.

00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:00.561
But I'm not willing to do that
by punishing hard-working

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:04.461
physicians or the millions of
Americans who count on Medicare.

00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:05.728
That's just wrong.

00:02:05.728 --> 00:02:07.294
And that's why in
the short-term,

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:10.895
Congress must act to prevent
this pay cut to doctors.

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:14.795
If they don't act, doctors will
see a 21% cut in their Medicare

00:02:14.795 --> 00:02:16.895
payments this week.

00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:19.227
This week, doctors will
start receiving these lower

00:02:19.227 --> 00:02:22.094
reimbursements from
the Medicare program.

00:02:22.094 --> 00:02:25.494
That could lead them to stop
participating in the Medicare program.

00:02:25.494 --> 00:02:28.928
And that could lead seniors
to lose their doctors.

00:02:28.928 --> 00:02:30.728
We can't allow this to happen.

00:02:30.728 --> 00:02:33.661
We have to fix this problem so
that our doctors can get paid

00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:36.695
for the life-saving services
they provide and keep their

00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:38.061
doors open.

00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:41.094
We have to fix this problem to
keep the promise of Medicare for

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:44.661
our seniors so that they get
the health care they deserve.

00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:47.994
So I urge Republicans in the
Senate to at least allow a

00:02:47.994 --> 00:02:51.961
majority of Senators and
Congressmen to stop this pay cut.

00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:56.161
I urge them to stand with
America's seniors and America's doctors.

00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:57.261
Thanks.
