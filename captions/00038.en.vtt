00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.711
The President: This week,
the United States and our

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.980
international international partners finally achieved

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.382
something that decades of

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:19.386
animosity has not - a deal
that will prevent Iran from

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:22.055
obtaining a nuclear weapon.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.057
This deal will make America
and the world safer

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.126
and more secure.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:28.795
Still, you're going to hear
a lot of overheated and

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.898
often dishonest arguments
about it in the weeks ahead.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:35.301
So today, I want to take a
moment to take those on one

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:39.305
by one, and explain
what this deal does and

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:40.306
what it means.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.309
First, you'll hear some
critics argue that this deal

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.879
somehow makes it easier for
Iran to obtain a nuclear

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.080
weapon.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.516
Now, if you think it sounds
strange that the United

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:53.386
States, Great Britain,
France, Germany, Russia,

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.688
China, and some of the
world's best nuclear

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.658
scientists would agree to
something like that, you're

00:00:58.658 --> 00:00:59.826
right.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:03.062
This deal actually closes
off Iran's pathway to a

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:04.697
nuclear weapon.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:07.033
Today, Iran has enough
nuclear material to produce

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:09.235
up to 10 nuclear weapons.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.872
With this deal, they'll have
to ship 98% of that material

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:16.176
out of the country - leaving
them with a fraction of what

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:19.112
it takes to make
even one weapon.

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:22.015
With this deal, they'll have
to repurpose two key nuclear

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:24.784
facilities so they can't
produce materials that could

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.719
be used for a
nuclear weapon.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.089
So this deal actually pushes
Iran further away from a

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.257
bomb.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:34.394
And there's a permanent
prohibition on Iran ever

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:35.662
having a nuclear weapon.

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:40.834
Second, you might hear from
critics that Iran could just

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:44.070
ignore what's required and
do whatever they want.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.574
That they're inevitably
going to cheat.

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:50.410
Well, that's wrong, too.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.113
With this deal, we will
have unprecedented, 24/7

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:57.317
monitoring of Iran's
key nuclear facilities.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:59.319
With this deal,
international inspectors

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.323
will have access to Iran's
entire nuclear supply chain.

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.859
The verification process
set up by this deal is

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.929
comprehensive and it is
intrusive - precisely so we

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.765
can make sure Iran
keeps its commitments.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:17.303
Third, you might hear from
critics that Iran faces no

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:20.173
consequences if it
violates this deal.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:23.042
That's also patently false.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:26.079
If Iran violates this deal,
the sanctions we imposed

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.515
that have helped cripple
the Iranian economy - the

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:31.584
sanctions that helped make
this deal possible - would

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.820
snap back into
place promptly.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:38.124
There's a reason this deal
took so long to negotiate.

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:41.361
Because we refused
to accept a bad deal.

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:44.564
We held out for a deal that
met every one of our bottom

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:45.565
lines.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.066
And we got it.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.602
Does this deal resolve all
of the threats Iran poses to

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.037
its neighbors and the world?

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:52.205
No.

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:55.542
Does it do more than anyone
has done before to make sure

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:58.278
Iran does not obtain
a nuclear weapon?

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.279
Yes.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.282
And that was our top
priority from the start.

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.517
That's why it's in
everyone's best interest to

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.553
make sure this deal holds.

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:10.189
Because without this deal,
there would be no limits on

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.925
Iran's nuclear program.

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:14.360
There would be no
monitoring, no inspections.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.297
The sanctions we rallied
the world to impose would

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:18.431
unravel.

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:21.434
Iran could move closer
to a nuclear weapon.

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:23.436
Other countries in the
region might race to do the

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:24.404
same.

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:27.507
And we'd risk another war in
the most volatile region in

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:29.008
the world.

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.110
That's what would happen
without this deal.

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:35.281
On questions of war and
peace, we should have tough,

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.483
honest, serious debates.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.819
We've seen what
happens when we don't.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.522
That's why this deal is
online for the whole world

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:43.756
to see.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.258
I welcome all scrutiny.

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:47.660
I fear no questions.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.663
As Commander-in-Chief, I
make no apology for keeping

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:52.966
this country safe and secure
through the hard work of

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:55.635
diplomacy over the
easy rush to war.

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:58.605
And on Tuesday, I'll
continue to press this case

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:01.574
when I address the national
convention of the Veterans

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.575
of Foreign Wars.

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:05.445
Because nobody understands
the true cost of war better

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.614
than those who've actually
served in this country's

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:08.615
uniform.

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:11.351
We have before us an
historic opportunity to

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.587
pursue a safer, more secure
world for our children.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:17.256
It might not come around
again in our lifetimes.

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.692
That's why we're going to
seize it today - and keep

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:23.162
America a beacon of hope,
liberty, and leadership for

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.163
generations to come.

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:27.233
Thank you, and have
a great weekend.
