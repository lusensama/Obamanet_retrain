The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.834
This week, I visited a company
in Raleigh, North Carolina,

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:16.800
that helps make electric motors

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.900
that save businesses
money on energy costs

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.633
and cut harmful
carbon pollution.

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:23.834
And I stopped by
N.C. State University,

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:27.100
where engineers are set
to develop the new technology

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.867
that will make those
motors even better.

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:32.667
It's part of my push not only
to make America home

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:34.834
to more high-tech
manufacturing -

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.734
but to make
America more attractive

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:40.233
for the good jobs that a
growing middle class requires.

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:42.667
And increasingly, we are.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:44.700
Thanks in part to our
all-of-the-above strategy

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.266
for American energy,

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.166
for the first time
in nearly two decades,

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.400
we produce more oil 
here at home

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.166
than we buy from
the rest of the world.

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.700
We generate more renewable
energy than ever,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.000
and more natural
gas than anybody.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.233
Health care costs are growing

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:01.467
at their slowest
rate in 50 years -

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:03.333
due in part to the
Affordable Care Act.

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.667
And since I took office,

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:08.266
we've cut our deficits
by more than half.

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.433
So we are primed to bring
back more of the good jobs

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:11.934
claimed by the recession,

00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:15.000
and lost to overseas
competition in recent decades.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.667
But that requires
a year of action.

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:19.166
And I want to work
with Congress this year

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.066
on proven ways to create jobs,

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.400
like building infrastructure

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.233
and fixing our broken 
immigration system.

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:28.967
Where Congress isn't acting,
I'll act on my own to put

00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:31.000
opportunity within reach
for anyone who's willing

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.700
to work for it.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.600
That's what I did in Raleigh
by launching America's

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.767
second "manufacturing
innovation institute."

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:39.700
It's a partnership between
companies, colleges,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.066
and the federal government

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:44.467
focused on making sure American 
businesses and American workers

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:47.066
win the race for
high-tech manufacturing

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.700
and the jobs that come with it -

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.700
jobs that can help
people and communities

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.834
willing to work hard punch their 
ticket into the middle class.

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:56.533
I firmly believe
that this can be

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.166
a breakthrough
year for America.

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.567
But to make that happen,
we're going to have to act -

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:03.834
to create good jobs
that pay good wages,

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:06.934
and to offer more Americans
a fair shot to get ahead.

00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:09.133
That's what I'm focused on every
day that I have the privilege

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:11.166
of serving as your president.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:12.700
That's what I'm
going to be focused on

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.967
every single day of this year.

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:17.033
Thanks,
and have a great weekend.
