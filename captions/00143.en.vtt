The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:09.266
This week, I've been speaking
about America's national

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:13.600
security -- our past, our
present, and our future.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.567
On Thursday, I outlined the
future of our fight against

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:19.767
terrorism -- the threats we
face, and the way in which we

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:21.133
will meet them.

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:24.033
On Friday, I went to Annapolis
to celebrate the extraordinary

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:26.600
young men and women of the
United States Naval Academy's

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.367
Class of 2013 -- the sailors and
Marines who will not only lead

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:35.000
that fight, but who will lead our
country for decades to come.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.800
And on Monday, we
celebrate Memorial Day.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.800
Unofficially, it's
the start of summer --

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.133
a chance for us to spend some
time with family and friends,

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.967
at barbecues or the beach,
getting a little fun and

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:48.900
relaxation in before
heading back to work.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.467
It's also a day on which
we set aside some time,

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:55.900
on our own or with our families,
to honor and remember all the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.000
men and women who have given
their lives in service to this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.900
country we love.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.667
They are heroes,
each and every one.

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:07.200
They gave America the most
precious thing they had --

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200
"the last full
measure of devotion."

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.633
And because they did, we
are who we are today --

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:17.433
a free and prosperous nation,
the greatest in the world.

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:20.767
At a time when only about 1% of
the American people bear the

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:24.433
burden of our defense, the
service and sacrifice of our men

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:28.233
and women in uniform isn't
always readily apparent.

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:30.400
That's partly because our
soldiers, sailors, airmen,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.200
Marines and coast guardsmen are
so skilled at what they do.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.233
It's also because those who
serve tend to do so quietly.

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:40.133
They don't seek the limelight.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.133
They don't serve
for our admiration,

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.800
or even our gratitude.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.867
They risk their lives,
and many give their lives,

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:50.133
for something larger than
themselves or any of us:

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:52.767
the ideals of liberty and
justice that make America a

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:54.567
beacon of hope for the world.

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:56.667
That's been true
throughout our history --

00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:59.433
from our earliest days, when a
tiny band of revolutionaries

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:03.166
stood up to an Empire,
to our 9/11 Generation,

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:06.367
which continues to serve
and sacrifice today.

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:10.800
Every time a threat has risen,
Americans have risen to meet it.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.533
And because of that courage
-- that willingness to fight,

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:17.667
and even die -- America endures.

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:20.500
That is the purpose
of Memorial Day.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.767
To remember with gratitude the
countless men and women who gave

00:02:24.767 --> 00:02:28.900
their lives so we could know
peace and live in freedom.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.400
And we must do
more than remember.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.066
We must care for the loved ones
that our fallen service members

00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:35.800
have left behind.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800
We must make sure all our
veterans have the care and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.467
benefits they've earned,
and the jobs and opportunity

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:42.333
they deserve.

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:45.100
We must be there for the
military families whose loved

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.600
ones are in harm's way --
for they serve as well.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.567
And above all, we must make sure
that the men and women of our

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:53.867
armed forces have the support
they need to achieve their

00:02:53.867 --> 00:02:57.567
missions safely at
home and abroad.

00:02:57.567 --> 00:03:00.600
The young men and women I met at
the Naval Academy this week know

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.367
the meaning of service.

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:04.700
They've studied the
heroes of our history.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.300
They've chosen to follow
in their footsteps --

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.600
to stand their watch, man
a ship, lead a platoon.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.834
They are doing their part.

00:03:14.834 --> 00:03:17.133
And each of us must do ours.

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.600
So this weekend, as we
commemorate Memorial Day,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.266
I ask you to hold all our
fallen heroes in your hearts.

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:27.066
And every day, let's work
together to preserve what their

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:30.633
sacrifices achieved -- to make
our country even stronger,

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:33.467
even more fair, even more free.

00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:35.400
That's our mission.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.967
It's our obligation.

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:40.700
And it is our privilege, as the
heirs of those who came before

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.300
us, and as citizens of the
United States of America.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.300
Thanks.
