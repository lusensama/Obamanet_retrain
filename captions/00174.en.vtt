00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:07.433
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:10.100
Last week, without much fanfare,
Members of the House of

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.367
Representatives banged a
gavel, turned out the lights,

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:17.066
and rushed home, declaring
their work finished for now.

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.233
If that frustrates
you, it should --

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:21.734
because their work
isn't finished.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:24.467
See, when they skipped town,
Members of Congress left a whole

00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:26.934
bunch of proposals
sitting on the table --

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:30.033
actions that would create
jobs, boost our economy,

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:32.533
and strengthen
middle-class security.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.000
These ideas have been
around for months.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.567
The American people
want to see them passed.

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:40.200
But apparently, some Members of
Congress are more worried about

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.834
their jobs and their paychecks
this campaign season than they

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:44.266
are about yours.

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.400
Right now, if Congress
had done the right thing,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.166
we would be on our way to having
a veterans' jobs corps that

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:52.533
helps returning heroes find work
as cops and firefighters in

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.734
communities all
across the country.

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:57.266
These men and women have made
incredible sacrifices for

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.266
our country.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.266
They shouldn't have to worry
about finding a job when

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.500
they get home.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.567
But last week, Republicans
in Congress voted it down.

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:06.467
And then they left.

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:08.533
Right now, if Congress had
gotten its act together,

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.934
we would have a farm bill to
help farmers and ranchers

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:13.767
respond to natural disasters
like the drought we had

00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:14.967
this summer.

00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:17.433
And we'd have made necessary
reforms to give our rural

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:20.000
communities some
long-term certainty.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.133
But so far, Republicans
in Congress have

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.500
dragged their feet.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.433
And now they're gone.

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:26.967
Right now, if
Congress had acted,

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:29.266
thousands of responsible
homeowners could be saving an

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:33.233
extra $3,000 a year on their
mortgages by refinancing at

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:35.200
historically low rates.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.166
But instead, Republicans in
Congress decided that working

00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:39.734
families could wait.

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:42.500
And now they'll have to
wait a little longer.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.333
And finally, if Congress
had listened to you,

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:48.333
they would have given 98% of
Americans and 97% of small

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:52.433
business owners a guarantee that
your taxes won't go up next year

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:54.033
by a single dime.

00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:55.867
This is something
we all agree on.

00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:57.934
It should have gotten
done a long time ago.

00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:01.266
But Republicans in Congress
have refused to budge.

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:04.767
They're holding tax cuts for 98%
of Americans hostage until we

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:08.200
pass tax cuts for the
wealthiest 2% of Americans.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.166
And now middle-class families
and small business owners are

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:14.633
left wondering what their tax
bill will look like next year.

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:17.100
All of these ideas would
strengthen our economy and help

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.000
the middle class right now.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.767
All of them are
supported by Democrats,

00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:22.834
Republicans and Independents.

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:24.700
There's no reason to wait.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.367
That's why, after going home and
listening to their constituents

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:30.000
for a few weeks, Members of
Congress should come back in

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.433
November and do this work.

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:35.100
They should do the right thing
for veterans and farmers;

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.834
for responsible homeowners
and small businesses;

00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:41.200
for Americans everywhere who
are just trying to get ahead.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.066
And if you agree with
me, I need your help.

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.467
Tell your Members of Congress
you can't afford to wait

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:47.767
any longer.

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:50.333
If you get an answering
machine, leave a message.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:53.800
If you see them campaigning
back home, tell them in person.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.533
Because there's
been enough talk.

00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:57.066
It's time for action.

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:59.667
That's what you deserve, and
that's what it's going to take

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:01.767
to move this country forward.

00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:03.767
Thanks, and have a
wonderful weekend.
