00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.767
The President:
This week marked a historic
moment in the life of our

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:10.133
country and our military.

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:14.200
For nearly nine years, our
nation has been at war in Iraq.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.734
More than 1.5 million Americans
have served there with honor,

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:20.066
skill, and bravery.

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.467
Tens of thousands
have been wounded.

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:25.600
Military families have
sacrificed greatly --

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.200
none more so than the families
of those nearly 4,500 Americans

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.500
who made the ultimate sacrifice.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.400
All of them -- our troops,
veterans, and their families --

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.767
will always have the thanks
of a grateful nation.

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:42.734
On Thursday, the colors our
Armed Forces fought under in

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:46.100
Iraq were formally cased in
a ceremony in Baghdad before

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.467
beginning their
journey back home.

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:50.900
Our troops are now preparing to
make their final march across

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.367
the border and out
of the country.

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:56.633
Iraq's future will be in
the hands of its own people.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:58.767
Our war there will be over.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:01.333
All of our troops
will be out of Iraq.

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:04.800
And this holiday season,
all of us can finally say:

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.367
welcome home.

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:08.633
This is an extraordinary
achievement --

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:11.200
one made possible by the hard
work and sacrifice of the men

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.467
and women who had
the courage to serve.

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:15.266
And there's a lesson
to learn from that --

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:18.233
a lesson about our
character as a nation.

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:20.667
See, there's a reason our
military is the most respected

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:22.667
institution in America.

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:26.000
They don't see themselves or
each other as Democrats first or

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.567
Republicans first.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:30.400
They see themselves
as Americans first.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.333
For all of our differences,
all of our disagreements,

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:36.867
they remind us that we are all
a part of something bigger;

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:39.834
that we are one
nation and one people.

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:42.867
And for all our challenges, they
remind us that there is nothing

00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:45.867
we can't do when
we stick together.

00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:48.467
They're the finest our
nation has to offer.

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:51.834
Many will remain in the military
and go on to the next mission.

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:55.100
Others will take off the
uniform and become veterans.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.767
But their commitment to service
doesn't end when they take off

00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:00.667
the uniform -- in fact, I'm
confident the story of their

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:03.700
service to America
is just beginning.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.567
After years of rebuilding
Iraq, it's time to enlist our

00:02:06.567 --> 00:02:10.467
veterans and all our people in
the work of rebuilding America.

00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:13.100
Folks like my grandfather came
back from World War II to form

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.066
the backbone of the largest
middle class in history.

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:17.867
And today's generation
of veterans --

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:20.100
the 9/11 Generation
of veterans --

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.433
is armed with the
skills, discipline,

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:26.133
and leadership to attack the
defining challenge of our time:

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:29.133
rebuilding an economy
where hard work pays off,

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:33.934
responsibility is rewarded, and
anyone can make it if they try.

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:37.200
Now it is up to us to serve
these brave men and women as

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.367
well as they serve us.

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:41.333
Every day, they meet their
responsibilities to their

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:43.767
families and their country.

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:47.033
Now it's time to meet ours --
especially those of us who you

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:49.200
sent to serve in Washington.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.066
This cannot be a country where
division and discord stand in

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:54.166
the way of our progress.

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:56.567
This is a moment where we must
come together to ensure that

00:02:56.567 --> 00:02:59.867
every American has the chance
to work for a decent living,

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:02.200
own their own home, send
their kids to college,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.600
and secure a decent retirement.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.300
This is a moment for us to build
a country that lives up to the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.066
ideals that so many of our
bravest Americans have fought

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:12.000
and even died for.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.367
That's our highest
obligation as citizens.

00:03:14.367 --> 00:03:18.166
That is the welcome home
that our troops deserve.

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:19.166
Thanks.
