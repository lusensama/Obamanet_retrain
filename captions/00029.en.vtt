00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:09.743
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:12.445
It's hard to believe, but
it was seven years ago this

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.881
week that one of Wall
Street's biggest investment

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.784
banks went bankrupt,
triggering a meltdown on

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.920
Wall Street and the worst
economic crisis since the

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.322
Great Depression.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.257
And in the months that
followed, millions of

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:27.694
Americans lost their jobs,
their homes, and the savings

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.130
they'd worked so
hard to build.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.632
Today's a different story.

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:35.235
Over the past five and a
half years, our businesses

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.171
have created more than
13 million new jobs.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:40.840
The unemployment rate is
lower than it's been in over

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.442
seven years.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.043
Manufacturing is growing.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.312
Housing is bouncing back.

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:49.482
We've reduced our
deficits by two-thirds.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.818
And 16 million more
Americans now know the

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.087
security of
health insurance.

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:56.589
This is your progress.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.659
It's because of your hard
work and sacrifice that

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.195
America has come back from
crisis faster than almost

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.231
every other advanced
nation on Earth.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:09.436
We remain the safest,
strongest bet in the world.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:12.939
Of course, you might not
know all that if you only

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.841
listened to the bluster of
political season, when it's

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.710
in the interest of some
politicians to paint America

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.980
as dark and depressing
as possible.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.117
But I don't see it that way.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:26.386
I've met too many Americans
who prove, day in and day

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:29.489
out, that this is a place
where anything is possible.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:32.525
Yes, we have a lot of work
to do to rebuild a middle

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.994
class that's had the odds
stacked against it now

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.329
for decades.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.731
That's the thing about
America - our work is

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.867
never finished.

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:43.102
We always strive to be
better - to perfect ourselves.

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:45.772
We just have to make
the right choices.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:49.476
And if Republicans want to
help, they can choose, right

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:52.078
now, to pass a budget that
helps us grow our economy

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:55.748
even faster, create jobs
even faster, lift people's

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:59.185
incomes and prospects
even faster.

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:02.188
But they've only got until
the end of the month to do

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.557
it - or they'll shut down
our government for the

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:06.693
second time in two years.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:09.996
Democrats are ready to sit
down and negotiate with

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:11.831
Republicans right now.

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:14.267
But it should be over
legitimate issues like how

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:17.270
much do we invest in
education, job training, and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.373
infrastructure - not
unrelated ideological issues

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:22.342
like Planned Parenthood.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.744
We need to set our
sights higher than that.

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:27.714
We need to reverse harmful
cuts to middle-class

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:31.284
economic priorities, close
loopholes that benefit only

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:34.053
a fortunate few at the top,
and invest more in the

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.723
things that help our
entire economy grow.

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:40.126
There's nothing principled
about the idea of another

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:41.995
government shutdown.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.697
There's nothing patriotic
about denying the progress

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:46.900
you've worked
so hard to make.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.137
America is great right
now - not because of our

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:54.340
government, or our wealth,
or our power, but because of

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.110
everyone who works hard
every day to move this

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.978
country forward.

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:01.514
Now Congress needs to
work as hard as you do.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.951
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
