00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:07.367
The President:
Hi everybody.

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:09.266
This week, because Democrats

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.700
and responsible
Republicans came together,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.500
the government was reopened,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.867
and the threat of default
was removed from our economy.

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:18.266
There's been a lot
of discussion lately

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.133
of the politics
of this shutdown.

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:23.100
But the truth is,
there were no winners in this.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.433
At a time when our economy
needs more growth and more jobs,

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:29.233
the manufactured crises
of these last few weeks

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:30.934
actually harmed jobs and growth.

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:33.767
And it's understandable
that your frustration

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:37.934
with what goes on in Washington
has never been higher.

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:41.400
The way business is done in
Washington has to change.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.166
Now that these clouds of crisis
and uncertainty have lifted,

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.367
we need to focus on what
the majority of Americans

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:48.967
sent us here to do -

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:51.367
grow the economy,
create good jobs,

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:53.133
strengthen the middle class,

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.900
lay the foundation
for broad-based prosperity,

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.266
and get our fiscal house
in order for the long haul.

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.333
It won't be easy.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.000
But we can make progress.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.700
Specifically, there are three
places where I believe

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.667
that Democrats and Republicans
can work together right away.

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:12.600
First, we should sit down and
pursue a balanced approach

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.433
to a responsible budget,

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:16.467
one that grows
our economy faster

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:19.567
and shrinks our long-term
deficits further.

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:21.233
There is no choice
between growth

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:22.467
and fiscal responsibility -

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:23.967
we need both.

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:25.533
So we're making
a serious mistake

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:29.066
if a budget doesn't focus
on what you're focused on:

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:32.233
creating more good jobs
that pay better wages.

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:34.066
If we're going to free up
resources for the things

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.467
that help us grow -

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:38.467
education, infrastructure, research -

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:40.367
we should cut
what we don't need,

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.100
and close corporate
tax loopholes

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.367
that don't help create jobs.

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:47.767
This shouldn't be as difficult
as it has been in past years.

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:51.900
Remember, our deficits are
shrinking - not growing.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.066
Second, we should
finish the job of fixing

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:56.200
our broken immigration system.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.266
There's already a broad
coalition across America

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:00.734
that's behind this effort,
from business leaders to faith

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:03.066
leaders to law enforcement.

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.834
It would grow our economy.

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:06.700
It would secure our borders.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.300
The Senate has
already passed a bill

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.700
with strong bipartisan support.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.500
Now the House should, too.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.934
The majority of Americans thinks
this is the right thing to do.

00:02:15.934 --> 00:02:19.667
It can and should get done
by the end of this year.

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:21.800
Third, we should
pass a farm bill -

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.033
one that America's farmers
and ranchers can depend on,

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:26.633
one that protects vulnerable
children and adults

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:27.900
in times of need,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.066
and one that gives rural
communities opportunities

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:33.800
to grow and the longer-term
certainty they deserve.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.500
We won't suddenly
agree on everything

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.133
now that the cloud
of crisis has passed.

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:41.233
But we shouldn't hold back
on places where we do agree,

00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:43.300
just because we don't
think it's good politics,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.467
or just because the
extremes in our parties

00:02:45.467 --> 00:02:47.600
don't like compromise.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.300
I'll look for willing partners
from either party

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.734
to get important work done.

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:55.133
There's no good reason why
we can't govern responsibly,

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.433
without lurching from
manufactured crisis

00:02:57.433 --> 00:02:59.533
to manufactured crisis.

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:01.133
Because that isn't governing -

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:04.800
it's just hurting the people
we were sent here to serve.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.867
Those of us who have the
privilege to serve this country

00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:10.233
have an obligation to do
our job the best we can.

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:13.000
We come from different parties,
but we're Americans first.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.600
And our obligations to
you must compel all of us,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.533
Democrats and Republicans,
to cooperate, and compromise,

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:25.367
and act in the best interests
of this country we love.

00:03:25.367 --> 00:03:28.000
Thanks everybody,
and have a great weekend.
