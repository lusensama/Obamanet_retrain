00:00:08.861 --> 00:00:12.361
The President:
Last night, after weeks of long
and difficult negotiations over

00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:16.261
our national budget, leaders of
both parties came together to

00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:19.528
avert a government
shutdown, cut spending,

00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:21.728
and invest in our future.

00:00:21.728 --> 00:00:24.094
This is good news for
the American people.

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:27.161
It means that small businesses
can get the loans they need,

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.994
our families can get the
mortgages they applied for,

00:00:29.994 --> 00:00:33.194
folks can visit our
national museums and parks,

00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:35.628
and hundreds of thousands
of Americans will get their

00:00:35.628 --> 00:00:40.628
paychecks on time -- including
our brave men and women in uniform.

00:00:40.628 --> 00:00:43.394
This is an agreement to invest
in our country's future while

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:47.695
making the largest annual
spending cut in our history.

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:50.861
Like any compromise, this
required everyone to give ground

00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:53.094
on issues that were
important to them.

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:54.695
I certainly did.

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:57.594
Some of the cuts we agreed
to will be painful --

00:00:57.594 --> 00:01:00.461
programs people rely
on will be cut back;

00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:03.628
needed infrastructure
projects will be delayed.

00:01:03.628 --> 00:01:07.027
And I would not have made these
cuts in better circumstances.

00:01:07.027 --> 00:01:09.394
But we also prevented this
important debate from being

00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:12.594
overtaken by politics and
unrelated disagreements on

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:14.161
social issues.

00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:17.261
And beginning to live within our
means is the only way to protect

00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:21.061
the investments that will help
America compete for new jobs --

00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:24.161
investments in our kids'
education and student loans;

00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:28.061
in clean energy and
life-saving medical research.

00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:31.194
Reducing spending while still
investing in the future is just

00:01:31.194 --> 00:01:32.761
common sense.

00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:35.361
That's what families
do in tough times.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.828
They sacrifice where they
can, even if it's hard,

00:01:38.828 --> 00:01:41.828
to afford what's
really important.

00:01:41.828 --> 00:01:44.628
A few months ago, I was able
to sign a tax cut for American

00:01:44.628 --> 00:01:47.728
families because both parties
worked through their differences

00:01:47.728 --> 00:01:50.161
and found common ground.

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:53.494
Now, the same cooperation has
made it possible for us to move

00:01:53.494 --> 00:01:57.428
forward with the biggest annual
spending cut in history.

00:01:57.428 --> 00:02:00.795
And it's my sincere hope that we
can continue to come together as

00:02:00.795 --> 00:02:03.928
we face the many difficult
challenges that lie ahead --

00:02:03.928 --> 00:02:07.194
from creating jobs and growing
our economy to educating our

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:10.961
children and reducing
our long-term deficits.

00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:13.027
That's our responsibility.

00:02:13.027 --> 00:02:15.928
That's what the American
people expect us to do.

00:02:15.928 --> 00:02:18.394
And it's what the
American people deserve.
