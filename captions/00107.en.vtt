00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.867
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:14.033
In my State of the Union
Address, I talked about

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:16.967
the idea of
opportunity for all.

00:00:16.967 --> 00:00:19.867
Opportunity is the idea at
the heart of this country

00:00:19.867 --> 00:00:22.100
- that no matter who you
are or how you started

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.900
out, with hard work and
responsibility,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.767
you can get ahead.

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:28.934
I ran for President to
restore that idea,

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:32.633
and I'm even more passionate
about it today.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.800
Because while our economy
has been growing for four

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.467
years, and those at the
top are doing better than

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:40.834
ever, average wages
have barely budged.

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:42.900
Too many Americans are
working harder than ever

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.033
just to get by, let alone
get ahead - and that's

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:49.400
been true since long
before the recession hit.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.433
We've got to reverse
those trends.

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:53.033
We've got to build an
economy that works

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:55.767
for everyone, not just
a fortunate few.

00:00:55.767 --> 00:00:58.100
And the opportunity agenda
I laid out last week

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.166
will help us do that.

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.200
It's an agenda
with four parts.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.467
Number one: more new jobs.

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:07.100
Number two: training folks
with the skills

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.800
to fill those jobs.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.533
Number three: guaranteeing
every child access

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.633
to a world-class education.

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:16.367
And number four: making
sure that hard work pays

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:19.567
off, with wages you can
live on, savings you can

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:21.800
retire on, and health
insurance

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.066
that's there when you need it.

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.100
I want to work with
Congress

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.600
on this agenda where I can.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.333
But in this year of
action,

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.533
whenever I can take steps
without legislation to expand

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:35.967
opportunity for more
American families, I will.

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:39.734
I've got a pen and a phone
- a pen to take executive

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:42.000
action, and a phone
to rally citizens

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.533
and business leaders who are
eager to create new jobs

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.133
and new opportunities.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.000
And we've already begun.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.667
In Wisconsin, I ordered an
across-the-board reform

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:53.000
of our training programs
to train folks with the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.934
skills employers need, and
match them to good jobs

00:01:56.934 --> 00:01:59.333
that need to be
filled right now.

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:02.300
In Pittsburgh, I directed
the Treasury to create

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.967
"my-RA," a new way for
working Americans,

00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:07.734
even if you're not wealthy, to
start

00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:10.000
your own retirement savings.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.934
In Maryland, I rallied
the leaders of some

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:14.100
of America's biggest tech
companies to help us make

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.800
sure all our kids have
access to high-speed

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.400
internet and up-to-date
technology to help them

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.533
learn the skills they
need for the new economy.

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:24.834
And at the White House, I
brought together business

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:27.467
leaders who've committed
to helping more unemployed

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:29.367
Americans find work, no
matter

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:31.166
how long they've been looking.

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:33.166
And I directed the federal
government to make hiring

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:35.900
decisions the same
way - based on whether

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.333
applicants can do the job,
not when they

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:40.667
last had a job.

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:43.300
So when you hear me talk
about using my pen and my

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.700
phone to make a difference
for middle class Americans

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.967
and those working to get
into the middle class,

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:48.967
that's what I mean.

00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:50.967
And I'm going to keep
asking students and

00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:53.734
parents and business
leaders to help -

00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:55.767
because there are millions
of Americans outside

00:02:55.767 --> 00:02:58.233
Washington who are
tired of stale political

00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:01.100
arguments, ready to move
this country forward,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.934
and determined to restore
the founding vision of

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.100
opportunity for all.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.100
And so am I.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.500
Thanks, have a great
weekend, and to our

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.200
Olympians in
Sochi, go Team USA!
