00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:07.166
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.967
I'm speaking to you this week
from a factory in Petersburg,

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:14.200
Virginia, where they're bringing
on more than 100 new workers to

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.567
build parts for the next
generation of jet engines.

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:19.700
It's a story that's happening
more frequently across

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.000
our country.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.166
Our businesses just added
233,000 jobs last month --

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.633
for a total of nearly four
million new jobs over the

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:30.300
last two years.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.266
More companies are choosing
to bring jobs back and invest

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.600
in America.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.333
Manufacturing is adding jobs for
the first time since the 1990s,

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.900
and we're building more things
to sell to the rest of the world

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.100
stamped with three proud
words: Made in America.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.633
And it's not just that
we're building stuff.

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:51.166
We're building better stuff.

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:54.400
The engine parts manufactured
here in Petersburg will go into

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.800
the next-generation planes
that are lighter, faster,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.900
and more fuel-efficient.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.867
That last part is important.

00:01:01.867 --> 00:01:04.233
Because whether you're
paying for a plane ticket,

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:08.166
or filling up your gas tank,
technology that helps us get

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.367
more miles to the gallon is
one of the easiest ways to save

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:15.266
money and reduce our
dependence on foreign oil.

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:18.000
The recent spike in gas prices
has been another painful

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.567
reminder of why we have to
invest in this technology.

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:24.300
As usual, politicians have been
rolling out their three-point

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.967
plans for two-dollar gas: drill,
drill, and drill some more.

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:32.900
Well, my response is,
we have been drilling.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.567
Under my Administration, oil
production in America is at an

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:38.166
eight-year high.

00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:41.133
We've quadrupled the number
of operating oil rigs,

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:44.400
and opened up millions
of acres for drilling.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.800
But you and I both know that
with only 2% of the world's oil

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.233
reserves, we can't just drill
our way to lower gas prices --

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:55.300
not when we consume
20% of the world's oil.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.400
We need an all-of-the-above
strategy that relies less on

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.033
foreign oil and more on
American-made energy --

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:08.166
solar, wind, natural
gas, biofuels, and more.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.500
That's the strategy
we're pursuing.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.834
It's why I went to a plant in
North Carolina earlier this

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:16.300
week, where they're making
trucks that run on natural gas,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.000
and hybrid trucks that go
further on a single tank.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.800
And it's why I've been focused
on fuel efficient cars since I

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.233
took office.

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:27.266
Over the last few years, the
annual number of miles driven by

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:29.900
Americans has stayed
roughly the same,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.533
but the total amount of gas
we use has been going down.

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:37.066
In other words, we're getting
more bang for our buck.

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:40.467
If we accelerate that trend,
we can help drivers save a

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:42.633
significant amount of money.

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:44.633
That's why, after 30
years of inaction,

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:47.533
we finally put in place new
standards that will make sure

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:51.500
our cars average nearly 55 miles
per gallon by the middle of the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.333
next decade -- nearly
double what they get today.

00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:58.367
This wasn't easy: we had to
bring together auto companies,

00:02:58.367 --> 00:03:02.867
and unions, and folks who don't
ordinarily see eye to eye.

00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:04.467
But it was worth it.

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:07.667
Because these cars aren't some
pie in the sky solution that's

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:08.934
years away.

00:03:08.934 --> 00:03:12.066
They're being built right
now -- by American workers,

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:15.266
in factories right
here in the U.S.A.

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:18.667
Every year, our cars and trucks
will be able to go further and

00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:22.266
use less fuel, and pretty soon,
you'll be able to fill up every

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:24.967
two weeks instead
of every week --

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:27.633
something that, over time, will
save the typical family more

00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:30.533
than $8,000 at the pump.

00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:34.600
We'll reduce our oil consumption
by more than 12 billion barrels.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.500
That is a future
worth investing in.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.266
So we have a choice.

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:41.567
Right now, some folks in
Washington would rather spend

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:46.367
another $4 billion on subsidies
to oil companies each year.

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:47.800
Well, you know what?

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.900
We've been handing out these
kinds of taxpayer giveaways for

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.834
nearly a century.

00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:55.834
And outside of Congress, does
anyone really think that's still

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:57.500
a good idea?

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.500
I want this Congress to stop
the giveaways to an oil industry

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.300
that's never been
more profitable,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.333
and invest in a clean energy
industry that's never been

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:07.066
more promising.

00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:09.400
We should be investing in the
technology that's building the

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.967
cars and trucks and jets that
will prevent us from dealing

00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:17.967
with these high gas prices
year after year after year.

00:04:17.967 --> 00:04:21.000
Ending this cycle of rising
gas prices won't be easy,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.300
and it won't happen overnight.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.400
But that's why you sent
us to Washington --

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.333
to solve tough
problems like this one.

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:30.800
So I'm going to keep doing
everything I can to help you

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.633
save money on gas, both
right now and in the future.

00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:38.166
I hope politicians from both
sides of the aisle join me.

00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:40.467
Let's put aside the
bumper-sticker slogans and

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:43.667
remember why we're here,
and get things done for the

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:45.133
American people.

00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:48.066
Thank you, God bless you,
and have a great weekend.
