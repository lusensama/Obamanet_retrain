00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.045
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.580
One of the most
consequential

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.582
responsibilities our
Constitution grants a

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:18.985
President is appointing
a Supreme Court Justice.

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:21.488
The men and women who sit on
the Supreme Court safeguard

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.722
our rights.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:25.725
They ensure that ours is a
system of laws, not of men.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.528
And they're given the
essential task of applying

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.431
the principles written into
our founding documents to

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.300
the most challenging
questions of today.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.803
So this is a duty I
take very seriously.

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:39.939
It requires me to set aside
short-term politics in order

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.709
to maintain faith
with our founders.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.478
And on Wednesday, after
weeks of consultations with

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.915
Republicans, Democrats, and
leaders across the country,

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:51.951
I selected a nominee whose
unmatched experience and

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.821
integrity have earned him
the respect and admiration

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:59.359
of both parties - Chief
Judge Merrick Garland.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.694
Judge Garland grew up in my
hometown of Chicago, with

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:04.964
parents who taught him to
work hard and deal fairly.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:07.400
As a young lawyer, he left
a lucrative private firm to

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.703
work for half as much
in public service.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:12.906
Eventually, he oversaw the
federal response to the

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:16.109
Oklahoma City bombing,
working side-by-side with

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.412
first responders, victims,
and their families to bring

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:22.081
justice for an
unspeakable crime.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.150
And everywhere he went
during that investigation,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.920
he carried with him in his
briefcase the program from

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.823
the memorial service with
each of the victims'

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:32.025
names inside.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:34.661
For the last 19 years, Judge
Garland has served on what's

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.831
known as "the second highest
court in the land" - the

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.533
D.C. Circuit Court -
including the last three

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.936
years as Chief Judge.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.438
On the bench, he's shown a
dedication to protecting our

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:46.873
basic rights.

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:49.876
A conviction that powerful
voices must not be allowed

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:52.812
to drown out those of
everyday Americans.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:54.981
An understanding that
justice isn't simply

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:59.853
abstract legal theory; it
affects people's daily lives.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:03.723
And a spirit of decency,
modesty, and even-handedness

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:05.425
in his work.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:08.528
Judge Garland is admired for
his courtesy, his devotion

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:11.798
to family, and his
civic-mindedness - for the

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.033
past 18 years, he's served
as a tutor for young

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:17.637
students at a local
D.C. elementary school.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:20.006
During my time as President,
through three separate

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.542
Supreme Court appointments,
in conversations with

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:26.112
Republicans and Democrats
alike, one name came up more

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:29.282
than any other -
Merrick Garland.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:31.618
I understand that we're in
the middle of an especially

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:33.987
noisy and volatile
political season.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:37.156
But at a time when our
politics are so polarized;

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:40.093
when norms and customs of
our political rhetoric seem

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:43.496
to be corroding - this is
precisely the time we should

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.432
treat the appointment of a
Supreme Court justice with

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:49.102
the seriousness it deserves.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:51.271
Because our Supreme Court
is supposed to be above

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:55.174
politics, not an
extension of politics.

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.377
And it should stay that way.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:00.613
So I ask Republicans in the
Senate to give Judge Garland

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:02.682
the respect he has earned.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:03.683
Give him a hearing.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.719
Give him an up-or-down vote.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.955
To deny it would be an
abdication of the Senate's

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.156
Constitutional duty.

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:13.126
It would indicate a
process for nominating and

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:15.495
confirming judges
that is beyond repair.

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.997
It would make it
increasingly impossible for

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:21.568
any President, Republican or
Democrat, to carry out their

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:23.836
Constitutional function.

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.872
To go down that path would
jeopardize our system of

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:29.842
justice, it would hurt our
democracy, and betray the

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:32.545
vision of our founding.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.348
I fulfilled my
Constitutional duty.

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:38.184
Now it's time for
Senators to do theirs.

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:40.353
I hope that they take the
time to reflect on the

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:43.823
importance of this
process to our country.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:45.792
I hope that
they'll act fairly.

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:49.128
And I hope they'll work
in a bipartisan fashion to

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:52.465
confirm Merrick Garland
to the Supreme Court.

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:54.534
That's how we can uphold
our pledge to liberty and

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:57.971
justice for all - for our
time and for generations

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.505
to come.

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:00.640
Thanks everybody.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.641
Have a good weekend.
