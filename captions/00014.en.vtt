00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:11.678
Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.914
When I took office seven
years ago this week,

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:19.085
more than 15% of Americans
went without health insurance.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.054
For folks who did
have coverage,

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.957
insurance companies could
deny you coverage or charge

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.693
you more just because
you'd been sick.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:29.396
And too many Americans gave
up their dreams of changing

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:32.632
jobs or going back to school
because they couldn't risk

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:36.269
giving up their
employer-based insurance plan.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.037
We've changed that.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:40.407
As the Affordable Care
Act has taken effect,

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:44.177
nearly 18 million Americans
have gained coverage.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.179
In fact, for the
first time ever,

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.915
more than 90 percent of
Americans are covered.

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:52.952
Up to 129 million Americans
with pre-existing conditions

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:57.891
can no longer be denied
coverage or be charged more

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.859
just because
they've been sick.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.496
137 million Americans with
private insurance are now

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:06.666
guaranteed preventive
care coverage.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.702
We've done all this while
cutting our deficits and

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:12.172
keeping health care
inflation to its lowest

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.307
levels in fifty years.

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:17.277
And we've begun filling the
gaps in employer-based care

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:20.346
so that when we change
jobs, lose a job,

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:23.049
go back to school, or
start that new business,

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.185
we can still get coverage.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.187
If you want to know
how important that is,

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.189
just ask an American
like Heather Bragg.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.191
Heather's a small business
owner in

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:32.192
Bluffton, South Carolina.

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.594
Last year, she wrote me a
letter and told me how,

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:37.497
for years, her family had
depended on her husband's

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:39.466
job for their insurance.

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.468
But thanks to the
Affordable Care Act,

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:44.304
her husband Mike had the
freedom to switch jobs and

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.706
join Heather at the small
business she'd launched a

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:48.274
few years ago.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.243
Through the Health
Insurance Marketplace,

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:52.645
they found better coverage
that actually saved them

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.747
hundreds of dollars a month.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.916
Today, Heather only pays
about ten dollars for the

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.219
asthma inhaler she needs.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.221
"For the first time,"
Heather wrote,

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.223
"we're not living
paycheck to paycheck;

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:05.758
we're able to pay our bills
and put some money back

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:07.393
into savings."

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.395
And because Mike doesn't
have to work nights or

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.464
weekends anymore, he can
coach their son's soccer

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.466
team and tuck the
kids in at night.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.436
And you can't put a price
on something like that.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.404
If you haven't looked at
your new coverage options,

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.640
you've still got time to
get covered on the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.344
Health Insurance
Marketplace for 2016.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:28.414
You have until January 31
- next Sunday - to enroll.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:33.286
Just go to HealthCare.gov,
CuidadoDeSalud.gov,

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.288
or call 1-800-318-2596.

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:39.959
Most folks buying a plan on
the Marketplace can find an

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.396
option that costs
less than $75 a month.

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.365
Even if you already
have insurance,

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.367
take a few minutes
to shop around.

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.369
In fact, consumers who
switched to a new plan for

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:53.273
2016 ended up saving an
average of more than $500.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:57.477
That's what the
Affordable Care Act did.

00:02:57.477 --> 00:03:00.213
This is health care
in America today.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:02.849
Affordable, portable
security for you

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.417
and your loved ones.

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:07.287
It's making a difference for
millions of Americans every day.

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.522
And it's only going
to get better.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.524
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
