00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.200
The President:
As many of you know,
early on Friday,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.967
at least twelve people were
killed when a gunman opened fire

00:00:10.967 --> 00:00:13.934
at a movie theater
in Aurora, Colorado.

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:17.400
Dozens more are being treated
for injuries at local hospitals.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.333
Some of the victims
are being treated at a

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.433
children's hospital.

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:23.600
We're still gathering all
the facts about what happened,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.567
but we do know that the police
have one suspect in custody.

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:29.900
The federal government stands
ready to do everything necessary

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.300
to bring whoever's responsible
for this heinous crime

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.767
to justice.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.967
We will take every step possible
to ensure the safety of all

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:38.300
our people.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.800
And we will stand by our
neighbors in Colorado during

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.166
this extraordinarily
difficult time.

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.500
Even as we come to learn
how this happened and who's

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.266
responsible, we may never
understand what leads anyone to

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.100
terrorize their
fellow human beings.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.900
Such evil is senseless
-- beyond reason.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.567
But while we will never know
fully what causes someone to

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:03.333
take the life of another,
we do know what makes life

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.467
worth living.

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:08.200
The people we lost in Aurora
loved, and were loved.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.700
They were mothers and
fathers; husbands and wives;

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.800
sisters and brothers;
sons and daughters;

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.667
friends and neighbors.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.133
They had hopes for the future
and dreams that were not

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.667
yet fulfilled.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:23.233
And if there's anything to
take away from this tragedy,

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:26.000
it's a reminder that
life is fragile.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.967
Our time here is limited
and it is precious.

00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:32.100
And what matters in the end are
not the small and trivial things

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.767
which so often
consume our lives.

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:38.700
It's how we choose to treat one
another, and love one another.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.867
It's what we do on a daily basis
to give our lives meaning and

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:44.100
give our lives purpose.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.867
That's what matters.

00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:48.300
That's why we're here.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.667
I'm sure many of you who are
parents had the same reaction I

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:54.100
did when you first heard this
news: what if it had been my

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.400
daughters at the theater, doing
what young children enjoy doing

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.066
every day?

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:01.633
Michelle and I will be fortunate
enough to hug our girls a little

00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:04.700
tighter this weekend, as
I'm sure you will do with

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.266
your children.

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:09.033
But for those parents who
may not be so fortunate,

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:12.467
we need to embrace them and let
them know we will be there for

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:14.967
them as a nation.

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:17.834
This weekend I hope everyone
takes some time for prayer and

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:21.834
reflection -- for the victims
of this terrible tragedy,

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:24.867
for the people who knew
them and loved them,

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:27.834
for those who are still
struggling to recover,

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:30.800
and for all the victims of less
publicized acts of violence that

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.834
plague our communities
on a daily basis.

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:36.800
Let's keep all these
Americans in our prayers.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.033
And to the people of Aurora, may
the Lord bring you comfort and

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:42.033
healing in the
hard days to come.
