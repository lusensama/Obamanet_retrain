00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.800
The President:
Today I'm at one of Honeywell's
manufacturing facilities in

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.033
Golden Valley, Minnesota, where
I just announced a step that

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.633
will make it easier for
companies to hire returning

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:17.000
service members who have
the skills our country

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.700
needs right now.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.633
It's another part of our effort
to make sure that no American

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:24.734
who fights for this country
abroad has to fight for a job

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:26.767
when they come home.

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:29.300
That's why businesses like
Honeywell are answering our

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.400
challenge to hire 100,000
post-9/11 veterans and their

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.133
spouses by the end of next year.

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:39.233
That's why I've directed the
government to hire over 200,000

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:42.467
veterans so far -- because our
economy needs their tremendous

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:45.800
talent, and because millions
of Americans are still looking

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.767
for a job.

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:50.600
Right now, this country is still
fighting our way back from the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600
worst economic crisis
since the Great Depression.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.066
The economy's growing again,
but it's not growing as fast

00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.600
as we'd like.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.934
Our businesses have created
almost 4.3 million new jobs over

00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:04.000
the last 27 months, but as we
learned in this week's jobs

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.600
report, we're not
creating them fast enough.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.033
And just like last
year at this time,

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:12.033
our economy faces some
serious headwinds.

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:13.834
Gas prices are starting
to come down again,

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:15.967
but when they spiked
over the last few months,

00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:18.734
it hit people's
wallets pretty hard.

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:23.500
The crisis in Europe's economy
is casting a shadow on our own.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.200
And all of this makes it even
more challenging to fully

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.533
recover and lay the foundation
for an economy that's

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.233
built to last.

00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:33.967
But from the moment we first
took action to prevent another

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:37.700
depression, we knew the road
to recovery wouldn't be easy.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.533
We knew it would take time, that
there would be ups and downs

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.033
along the way.

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:45.100
But we also knew that if we
were willing to act wisely,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.800
and boldly, and together; if
we were willing to keep at it,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.200
and never quit, we'd
come back stronger.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.266
Nothing has shaken my
faith in that belief.

00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:57.166
We will come back stronger.

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.533
We do have better days ahead.

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.533
And that's because of you.

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:04.333
I'd place my bet on American
workers and American businesses

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:05.934
any day of the week.

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:08.867
You're the reason our auto
industry has come roaring back.

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:11.767
You're the reason manufacturing
is hiring at its fastest pace

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:13.633
since the 1990s.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:14.633
You work hard.

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.133
You play by the rules.

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:18.934
And what you deserve are
leaders who will do the same;

00:02:18.934 --> 00:02:22.266
who will do whatever it takes to
fight for the middle-class and

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:24.500
grow this economy faster.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.633
Because while we can't fully
control everything that happens

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:30.333
in other parts of the world,
there are plenty of things we

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:32.400
can control here at home.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.266
There are plenty of steps we can
take right now to continue to

00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:39.300
create jobs and
grow this economy.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.500
I sent Congress a jobs bill last
September full of the kinds of

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.100
bipartisan ideas that would have
put our fellow Americans back to

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.133
work and helped reinforce
our economy against those

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:50.867
outside shocks.

00:02:50.867 --> 00:02:53.233
I sent them a plan that would
have reduced the deficit by

00:02:53.233 --> 00:02:55.500
$4 trillion in a way
that's balanced --

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.834
that pays for the job-creating
investments we need by cutting

00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:01.967
unnecessary spending and asking
the wealthiest Americans to pay

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:03.934
a little more in taxes.

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:07.266
Since then, Congress has only
passed a few parts of that jobs

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:10.133
bill, like a tax cut that's
allowing working Americans to

00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:12.734
keep more of your
paycheck every week.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:13.734
And that's important.

00:03:13.734 --> 00:03:17.200
But Congress hasn't acted on
enough of the other ideas in

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.800
that bill that would make
a difference and help create

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.533
jobs right now.

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.567
There's no excuse for that.

00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:26.500
Not when so many people
are looking for work.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.734
Not when so many people
are still struggling to

00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:30.500
pay the bills.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.767
So my message to Congress
is, let's get to work.

00:03:33.767 --> 00:03:37.400
Right now, Congress should pass
a bill to help states prevent

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.900
more layoffs, so we can put
thousands of teachers and

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.467
firefighters and police
officers back on the job.

00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:46.467
Congress should have passed
a bill a long time ago to put

00:03:46.467 --> 00:03:48.967
thousands of construction
workers back on the job

00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:52.633
rebuilding our roads and
our bridges and our runways.

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:55.500
Instead of just talking a
good game about job creators,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.300
Congress should give small
business owners a tax break for

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.900
hiring more workers and
paying them higher wages.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.100
Let's get all that done.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.734
Right now, Congress should give
every responsible homeowner the

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:12.367
opportunity to save an average
of $3,000 a year by refinancing

00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:13.867
their mortgage.

00:04:13.867 --> 00:04:16.200
Next week, there's a vote in
Congress on a bill that would

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.967
give working women the tools
they need to demand equal pay

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.400
for equal work.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.233
Ensuring paycheck fairness for
women should be a no-brainer.

00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:25.934
And they need to pass that bill.

00:04:25.934 --> 00:04:29.900
Right now, Congress also needs
to extend tax credits for clean

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.767
energy manufacturers that are
set to expire at the end of the

00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:36.700
year -- so that we don't walk
away from 40,000 good jobs that

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.433
are being created.

00:04:38.433 --> 00:04:41.233
And it's long past time for
Congress to end the tax breaks

00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:43.834
for companies that
ship jobs overseas,

00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:46.266
and use that money to cover
moving expenses for companies

00:04:46.266 --> 00:04:49.266
that are bringing
jobs back to America.

00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:53.567
It's not lost on anybody
that this is an election year.

00:04:53.567 --> 00:04:57.734
But we've got responsibilities
that are bigger than

00:04:57.734 --> 00:04:59.233
an election.

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:01.633
We've got
responsibilities to you.

00:05:01.633 --> 00:05:03.734
With so many people
struggling to get by,

00:05:03.734 --> 00:05:05.800
now is not the time
to play politics.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.467
Now is not the time for
Congress to sit on its hands.

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:11.166
The American people expect
their leaders to work hard,

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:13.367
no matter what year it is.

00:05:13.367 --> 00:05:14.900
That's what I intend to do.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.934
And I expect Democrats and
Republicans to join me.
