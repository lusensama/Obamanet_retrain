00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:07.333
The President:
Hi everybody.

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.400
On Wednesday, I spoke about what
we need to do as a country

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.900
to build a better bargain for
the middle class --

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.400
to make sure everyone who works
hard has a chance to get ahead

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.300
in the 21st century economy.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.700
You see, over the past
four and a half years,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.066
America has fought its way back
from the worst recession

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.934
of our lifetimes.

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:29.500
We saved the auto industry, took
on a broken health care system,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.500
invested in new American
technologies to reverse our

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.600
addiction to foreign oil, and
changed a tax code too skewed

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.033
in favor of the wealthiest at
the expense of working families.

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:44.600
As a result, our businesses have
created 7.2 million new jobs

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.700
over the past 40 months.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.100
We produce more renewable
energy than ever,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.600
and more natural
gas than anyone.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.333
Health care costs are growing
at the slowest rate in 50 years.

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:59.967
Our deficits are falling at
the fastest rate in 60 years.

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:02.367
Thanks to the grit and
resilience of the American

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:05.200
people, we've cleared away the
rubble of crisis and begun

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.667
to lay a new foundation
for stronger,

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.300
more durable economic growth.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.500
But as any middle-class
family will tell you,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.500
we're not yet where
we need to be.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.700
Trends that have been eroding
middle-class security for

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.767
decades -- technology that
makes some jobs obsolete,

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:24.967
global competition that
makes others moveable,

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:28.533
growing inequality and the
policies that perpetuate it --

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.934
all these things still
exist, and in some ways,

00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:33.200
the recession made them worse.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.200
Reversing these trends must be
Washington's highest priority.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.734
It sure is mine.

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:40.667
But over the past couple
of years in particular,

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.300
Washington has taken
its eye off the ball.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.600
An endless parade
of distractions,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.834
political posturing and phony
scandals shift focus from what

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:51.867
needs to be done.

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:54.667
And as Washington prepares to
enter another budget debate,

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.033
the stakes could not be higher.

00:01:57.033 --> 00:02:00.166
The choices we make now will
determine whether or not every

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:03.300
American has a fighting
chance in the 21st century.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.667
If we don't make the investments
necessary to make America

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:10.400
a magnet for good jobs -- if we
don't invest in education,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.533
and manufacturing, and research,
and our transportation and

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:17.033
information networks -- we might
as well hit the "pause" button

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:18.500
while the rest of the world
forges ahead

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.900
in a global economy.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.834
And that's certainly not going
to fix what ails

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:24.500
the middle class.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.667
Here's what will: a strategy
that builds on the cornerstones

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:30.166
of what it means to be
middle class in America,

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:33.233
and what it takes to work your
way into the middle class.

00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:35.200
Good jobs that pay good wages.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.200
An education that prepares our
children and our workers for the

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.600
global competition they'll face.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.367
Homeownership that's based
on a solid foundation,

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:46.667
where buyers and lenders play
by the same set of rules.

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:50.734
Affordable health care that's
there for you when you get sick.

00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:53.633
A secure retirement
even if you're not rich.

00:02:53.633 --> 00:02:57.066
More chances for folks to earn
their way into the middle class

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:59.900
as long as they're
willing to work for it.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.867
Over the next several weeks,
in cities and towns across

00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:05.967
the country, I'll continue to
lay out my ideas in each

00:03:05.967 --> 00:03:08.000
of these areas.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.533
Because reversing the forces
that have conspired against the

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:13.567
middle class for decades will
require more than short-term

00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:17.834
thinking; it will require a
long-term American strategy,

00:03:17.834 --> 00:03:20.500
based on steady,
persistent effort.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.400
I know there are members of both
parties who understand what's

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.667
at stake, and I'm open to ideas
from across the political

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:30.000
spectrum, as long as they meet
the test of strengthening

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.066
the prospects of
hard-working families.

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:36.533
But repealing Obamacare, gutting
critical investments in our

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:39.767
future, threatening to default
on the bills this country has

00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:42.934
already racked up, or shutting
down the government just because

00:03:42.934 --> 00:03:46.600
I'm for keeping it open -- none
of those thing add up

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.934
to an economic plan.

00:03:48.934 --> 00:03:53.400
None of that will take this
country where it needs to go.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.834
We can do this if
we work together.

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:59.233
It won't be easy, but if we
take a few bold steps -- and if

00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:02.033
Washington is willing to shake
off its complacency and set

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:05.300
aside some of the slash-and-burn
partisanship we've seen

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.300
in recent years -- our economy
will keep getting stronger.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.500
And as long as I have the
privilege of holding this

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.100
office, I will spend every
minute of every day doing

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.600
everything in my power to make
this economy work for working

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.333
Americans again; to build that
better bargain for the middle

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:25.200
class; to make sure that the
American Dream is something

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.066
that's achievable for
everybody -- not just today,

00:04:29.066 --> 00:04:31.400
but for decades to come.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.700
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
