00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:10.810
The President: Hi everybody.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.980
One of the remarkable things
about America is that nearly

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.449
all of our families
originally came from

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.017
someplace else.

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.786
We're a nation
of immigrants.

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:22.455
It's a source of our
strength and something we

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.290
all can take pride in.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.927
And this month - Immigrant
Heritage Month - is a chance

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:31.097
to share our
American stories.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:34.134
I think about my
grandparents in Kansas -

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:36.836
where they met and
where my mom was born.

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:40.473
Their family tree reached
back to England and Ireland

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:41.975
and elsewhere.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:45.145
They lived, and raised me,
by basic values: working

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:48.148
hard, giving back, and
treating others the way you

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.116
want to be treated.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.685
I think of growing up in
Hawaii, a place enriched by

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.721
people of different
backgrounds - native

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.690
Hawaiian, Filipino,
Japanese, Chinese,

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.027
Portuguese and just
about everything else.

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:04.998
Growing up in that vibrant
mix helped shape who I am today.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:08.001
And while my father was not
an immigrant himself, my own

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.537
life journey as an
African-American - and the

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:13.840
heritage shared by Michelle
and our daughters, some of

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.410
whose ancestors came here in
chains - has made our family

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.512
who we are.

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:23.516
This month, I'm inviting you
to share your story, too.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.518
Just visit
whitehouse.gov/NewAmericans.

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:30.323
We want to hear how you
or your family made it to

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:33.560
America - whether you're an
immigrant yourself or your

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.162
great-great-grandparents
were.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:39.265
Of course, we can't just
celebrate this heritage, we

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.701
have to defend it -
by fixing our broken

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.603
immigration system.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.172
Nearly two years ago,
Democrats and Republicans in

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.174
the Senate came
together to do that.

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:51.177
They passed a commonsense
bill to secure our border,

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:54.247
get rid of backlogs, and
give undocumented immigrants

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:57.617
who are already living here
a pathway to citizenship if

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:01.054
they paid a fine, paid their
taxes, and went to the back

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:02.489
of the line.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.824
But for nearly two years,
Republican leaders in the

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:08.061
House have refused to
even allow a vote on it.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:11.131
That's why, in the meantime,
I'm going to keep doing

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.334
everything I can to make our
immigration system more just

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:15.935
and more fair.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:19.439
Last fall, I took action to
provide more resources for

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.375
border security; focus
enforcement on the real

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.944
threats to our security;
modernize the legal

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.980
immigration system for
workers, employers, and

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.016
students; and bring more
undocumented immigrants out

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:33.219
of the shadows so they can
get right with the law.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.955
Some folks are still
fighting against these actions.

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:38.258
I'm going to keep
fighting for them.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:39.993
Because the law
is on our side.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.327
It's the right thing to do.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:44.531
And it will make
America stronger.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:48.635
I want us to remember people
like Ann Dermody from

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:50.436
Alexandria, Virginia.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.772
She's originally from
Ireland and has lived in

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:55.141
America legally for years.

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:57.410
She worked hard, played by
the rules and dreamed of

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.445
becoming a citizen.

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.948
In March, her
dream came true.

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:05.385
And before taking the oath,
she wrote me a letter.

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:09.622
"The papers we
receive...will not change

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.292
our different accents [or]
skin tones," Ann said.

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:13.993
"But for that day, at least,

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:17.096
we'll feel like we have arrived."

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:20.767
Well, to Ann and immigrants
like her who have come to

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:24.971
our shores seeking a better
life - yes, you have arrived.

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.640
And by sharing our stories,
and staying true to our

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.710
heritage as a nation of
immigrants, we can keep that

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.780
dream alive for
generations to come.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.782
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
