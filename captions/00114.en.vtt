00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:07.100
The President:
One year ago today,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.867
a quiet, peaceful town

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:12.100
was shattered by
unspeakable violence.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.000
Six dedicated school workers
and 20 beautiful children

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.100
were taken from
our lives forever.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.767
As parents, as Americans,
the news filled us with grief.

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:28.467
Newtown is a town like
so many of our hometowns.

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:30.700
The victims were
educators and kids

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.100
that could have been
any of our own.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.100
And our hearts were
broken for the families

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.567
that lost a piece
of their heart;

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:39.233
for the communities
changed forever;

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:41.767
for the survivors, so young,

00:00:41.767 --> 00:00:46.200
whose innocence was
torn away far too soon.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.200
But beneath the sadness,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.500
we also felt a
sense of resolve -

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.667
that these tragedies must end,

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:55.100
and that to end them,
we must change.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.734
From the very beginning,
our efforts were led

00:00:57.734 --> 00:00:59.967
by the parents of Newtown -

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:02.600
men and women,
impossibly brave,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.367
who stepped forward in the hopes

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:06.900
that they might spare
others their heartbreak.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.600
And they were joined by
millions of Americans -

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.467
mothers and fathers;
sisters and brothers -

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:16.367
who refused to accept
these acts of violence

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:19.033
as somehow inevitable.

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:21.633
Over the past year, their
voices have sustained us.

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:24.233
And their example
has inspired us -

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:27.166
to be better parents
and better neighbors;

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.433
to give our children
everything they need

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:31.700
to face the world without fear;

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.066
to meet our responsibilities
not just to our own families,

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.400
but to our communities.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.700
More than the tragedy itself,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.834
that's how Newtown
will be remembered.

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:43.867
And on this anniversary of
a day we will never forget,

00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:47.233
that's the example we
should continue to follow.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:50.300
Because we haven't yet done
enough to make our communities

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.367
and our country safer.

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:54.233
We have to do more to
keep dangerous people

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:57.333
from getting their hands
on a gun so easily.

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:01.033
We have to do more to
heal troubled minds.

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:03.567
We have to do everything we
can to protect our children

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:06.166
from harm and make
them feel loved,

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:09.467
and valued, and cared for.

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:12.133
And as we do, we can't
lose sight of the fact

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:14.100
that real change won't
come from Washington.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.533
It will come the way
it's always come -

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:18.800
from you.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.066
From the American people.

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:24.734
As a nation, we can't stop
every act of violence.

00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:27.000
We can't heal every
troubled mind.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.500
But if we want to live in a
country where we can go to work,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.066
send our kids to school,

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:34.834
and walk our streets
free from fear,

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:37.367
we have to keep trying.

00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:39.800
We have to keep caring.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.800
We have to treat every child
like they're our child.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.934
Like those in Sandy Hook,
we must choose love.

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:51.667
And together,
we must make a change.

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:53.633
Thank you.
