The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.533
Today, I'm speaking to
you from the road --

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.133
a trip to Mexico and Costa Rica.

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.767
I'm here because Latin America
represents an incredible

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:16.700
opportunity for
the United States,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.633
especially when it comes to
my top priority as President,

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:22.600
which is creating good,
middle-class jobs.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.367
On Friday, we learned that our
businesses created another

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:28.700
176,000 jobs last month.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.133
And that's 2.2 million new
jobs over the past year,

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:36.266
and 6.8 million new jobs
over the past 38 months.

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.667
But as I've said before, I won't
be satisfied until everyone who

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:41.533
wants a job can find one.

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:44.066
So I'm going to keep doing
everything I can and go

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:48.300
everywhere I need to go to help
our businesses create jobs.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.467
Now, one of the best ways to
grow our economy is to sell more

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.734
goods and services made
in America to the rest

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:53.967
of the world.

00:00:53.967 --> 00:00:56.633
And that includes our
neighbors to the south.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:01:00.567
Right now, over 40% of our
exports go to the Americas.

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:03.433
And those exports are growing
faster than our trade with the

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:04.800
rest of the world.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.166
That's why I visited Latin
America this week --

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.600
to work with leaders to deepen
our economic ties and expand

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.900
trade between our nations.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.500
In Mexico, I also talked
about immigration reform,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.700
because that's an important
issue that affects both

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.066
our countries.

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.200
The truth is, right now, our
border with Mexico is more

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.100
secure than it's been in years.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.166
We've put more boots on that
border than at any time in our

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:30.033
history, and illegal crossings
are down by nearly 80% from

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:31.734
their peak in 2000.

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:34.800
But we've got more to do -- not
just to secure the border but to

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.467
fix an immigration system
that is badly broken.

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:41.100
In recent weeks, we've seen a
commonsense immigration reform

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.400
bill introduced in the Senate.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.467
This bill is a compromise, which
means that nobody got everything

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:48.433
they wanted -- including me.

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:50.967
But it's largely consistent with
the principles I've laid out

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:52.467
from the beginning.

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:55.367
It would continue to strengthen
security at our borders and hold

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:57.834
employers more accountable
if they knowingly hire

00:01:57.834 --> 00:01:59.600
undocumented workers.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.867
It would provide a pathway to
earned citizenship for the 11

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:04.934
million individuals who
are already in this

00:02:04.934 --> 00:02:06.667
country illegally.

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:09.367
And it would modernize our legal
immigration system so that we're

00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:12.333
able to reunite families and
attract the highly-skilled

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:15.433
entrepreneurs and engineers who
will help create good paying

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:17.834
jobs and grow our economy.

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:20.166
These are all commonsense
steps that the majority of

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:21.633
Americans support.

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:24.033
So there's no reason that
immigration reform can't become

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:26.467
a reality this year.

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:28.800
In the meantime, I'll keep
working with our neighbors on

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.400
our common security and
our common prosperity.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.533
Millions of Americans earn a
living right now because of the

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:37.400
trade between our nations.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.266
And after this week, I'm as
confident as ever that we can

00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:44.500
build on our shared heritage and
values to open more markets for

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.667
American businesses and create
more jobs for American workers.

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:50.667
Thanks and have a great weekend.
